when i the supplementary budget to this house last april i said we could work our way through this period of economic today i can report that the difficulties of the past months we are now on the road to economic recovery it is of enormous benefit that the main political parties in this house share a common understanding of the extent of our difficulties and even if we on how to our problems our agreement on the amount of savings required a signal to the rest of the world that we are able and willing to put our own house in order today i want to tell the irish people that even though our economy is still in a and our self confidence as a nation has been the government's strategy over the past 18 months is working and we can now see the first of a recovery here at home and in our main international markets we have taken and steps to manage our way through this crisis in all our actions our has been to protect jobs to provide a banking system and to return this economy to the of sustainable growth we have to do all of this in a that is fair and that the most vulnerable the measures we have taken have been by international such as the european central bank the european commission the and the oecd they have also the of the international markets evidence of this is the reduction in our on borrowing in recent months we now have the confidence of that our plan to return this country to is working yes we have had to make some very difficult choices in today's budget and in doing so we have tried to be as fair as possible however by taking the difficult but necessary measures now we will rebuild our self confidence here at home and our abroad next steps towards recovery the government over the past 18 months has made adjustments of more than 8 billion for this year had we not done so the deficit would have towards 20 of our annual wealth a level at which the very financial of this country would have been at risk as a result of these actions we are now in a position to stabilise the deficit a total of 4 billion is the scale of adjustment that we planned for 2010 in the supplementary budget where we set out details to reduce the deficit over the coming years the european commission that plan but recently a of by which to reduce our deficit below 3 of gdp we welcome this but it does not change what needs to be done in this budget the amount of 4 billion is still the right target and our strategy is on in this next phase of the government's plan we must stabilise the deficit in a fair way those worst hit by the recession and stimulate sectors of our economy to sustain and create jobs the worst is over the international economy has recession recent suggest that economic in this country is the corner and my department a return to positive growth within the next six to months gdp has by approximately over the past year which is the fall since average gdp for 2010 as a whole is to be down by approximately from the average level in 2009 consumer prices have this year and a small is for next year by helping to restore competitiveness prices will allow us to take of the improving global economy economic prices will also the of reduced pay and social welfare payments the effort of every in this budget is substantial but it is the last big push of this crisis further will be needed in the coming years but none will be as big as that being introduced today having already provided for an adjustment of 1 billion in capital spending we have in an adjustment in day to day spending of approximately 2 billion for 2011 as economic conditions begin to assist in the deficit our objective has been to for fairness choices will always be with opposition the job of government is to between the common good and interests the response to the recent flooding throughout our country has shown what we can achieve when we all together in times of if we work together now and share the burden we can deliver sustainable economic growth for all the economy went into reverse for three reasons first a loss of competitiveness during a boom second the of the property and third an international banking crisis which a recession in the past 18 months we have put in place a range of far measures to stabilise the banking system we took those measures not for the of the banks but for the of our economy we have gone through a and in the property market i know this has dealt a to many of whom are now in negative equity and some of whom are difficulties meeting their mortgage however the collapse of the property has also on our public finances by reducing the tax take and increasing the demand for welfare payments in the two most recent budgets i to address this by introducing a progressive income levy and various other taxation measures a key feature and focus of today's budget is our international competitiveness our competitive unless we our competitive we will be to return to the tried and strategy of led growth that in the boom in the early we must be able to and again in the international in the recent on the the people ireland's place at the heart of europe this was the right decision for our economy for our future and for our children the single currency has provided huge and support to ireland in the current crisis it has on our currency and provided funding to the banking system however of union also means is not an option the adjustment process must be made by way of reductions in wages prices and some progress has already been made consumer prices in ireland are now at the rate in the euro area and the european commission has that in the euro area our labour costs will fall this year however our prices are still among the highest in europe during the past wages have gone up well above the euro area average put simply we have out of the market we will not be able to the of jobs until our prices and the costs of doing business here move down in line with those of our main partners why borrowing more is not the some have we should continue to borrow and wait for the economy to grow again before tackling the budget deficit there are three reasons this is not a first we know from the 1980s how large left can lead to a of debt and ever increasing interest payments never again should we return to a position where all of our income taxes go to pay interest on the national debt second international debt markets have become more and more if were to lose in our ability to restore order to the public finances the for our economic well being would be third only action will restore confidence will only start to spend and business will only invest and create jobs if they believe we are tackling our deficit problem now in our we do not borrow to pay our we cut back and to live within our means the same apply at national level borrowing hundreds of millions of euro a week to pay for day to day spending is just not on the deficit is the next key in our plan to deliver economic recovery for this country why we cannot tax our way out of this others have for increases in taxes as a means of the deficit however those who demand higher taxes to what i have already done the tax increases in the two most recent budgets have the burden on those best able to pay for example a single person earning now pays 500 more in tax and levies than in 2008 a single person on 100,000 pays around more or 11 times more than the person on and at the additional taxes and levies amount to almost or times the contribution of the person on the of these changes is beyond but we have the we will not create jobs by increasing the on work and investment how we tax income it is also clear that our income tax system has become very next year almost half of income earners will pay no income tax and 4 will pay almost half of the total yield if we want to sustain high levels of government services this must change the time has come to how we tax incomes and to the position and make it fairer and more based it is my objective to introduce in 2011 a new system of just two charges on income a new universal social contribution will prsi the health levy and the income levy it will be paid by everyone at a low rate and on a as a contribution to public services income tax will apply on a progressive basis to those with higher incomes their capacity to make a greater contribution these changes a challenge but we cannot continue with the current system with its i look forward to working with my colleagues in the government on this reform and the of the tax and social welfare system the tax in the programme for government we have the recommendations of the commission on taxation on the need for a property tax will need to be done before a tax can be introduced work will shortly begin on the of and the of the programme for government also a commitment to introduce a system of water for homes are under way in this regard water charges when introduced will be based on above a free further details will be announced by the minister for the environment heritage and local government these charges like the charge on second homes will finance the provision of local services by local authorities high earners must pay their fair share we have set our face against increasing the burden of income tax however the government wants high earners who of tax schemes to contribute more in the current difficult circumstances for the tax year 2010 the effective rate of income tax for those from reliefs will increase from 20 to 30 on top of which they will also pay prsi and levies this a significant of the and it will yield approximately million in a full year the point to the will now at an income level of with the full at i will examine the and of further reliefs in the context of the finance bill our tax of individuals is in line with that of most other oecd countries however we must ensure that every wealthy irish who pays little or no income tax a contribution to the state during times of economic and fiscal difficulty for this reason we will introduce measures which will impose on all irish and individuals whose income 1 million and whose irish capital is greater than 5 million a to pay an irish levy of 200,000 per annum of where they are tax full details in this regard will be set out in the finance bill i am also introducing a package of measures to improve the of the revenue in tackling the economy and excise and dealing with tax schemes carbon tax the economic and social of climate change are it is the responsibility of every government to change to reduce gas the most effective way to in this regard is to put a price on carbon this will encourage innovation by companies to bring low carbon and services to the market time but a start must be made i am introducing a carbon tax equivalent to 15 per the is set out in the of budget measures the tax will apply to and from increases in home and gas will apply from next may the of the tax to and will be to a order to allow a to be put in place to the of and from ireland where lower environmental standards apply a fuel allowance scheme will be developed to the increases for low income families on such the yield from the carbon tax will be used to energy efficiency support transport and fuel poverty the tax will also allow us to or reduce taxes carbon taxes will be a feature of economies across the world in the coming years today's a positive signal to those in working for an agreement on global climate change with regard to ireland's capacity to show leadership in this area the tax changes i am introducing my that tax can make some contribution to the reduction of the deficit and will make a contribution in later years as we know from our recent history we cannot rely on our way out of our difficulties the deficit in a fair way if we cannot tax our way out of our difficulties and we all agree in this house that we cannot borrow our way to recovery then the only option is to reduce our spending no one wants to cut spending but the cost of providing public services has to be reduced to bring it in line with sustainable revenue levels and to help restore our international competitiveness since we have made great in the level of public service provision we did so out of the best of and in response to public demand many in this house us for not doing more the current cost of providing public services is not sustainable without any day to day spending would be approximately billion in 2010 an increase of approximately 2 billion over 2009 given that public service pay and social welfare each account for about one third of all day to day spending reductions in these two areas are the measures i am announcing amount to savings of over 1 billion on the pay bill about million on social welfare some million on day to day spending and about million in savings on investment projects with other adjustments this to more than 4 billion expenditure savings to pre budget estimates adjustments to public service pay and pensions in my supplementary budget i announced my decision to have top level pay rates by the review body on higher in the public sector and against those of other eu countries of scale the government has considered the recommendations of the review body and to apply reductions to all public servants in the higher pay including hospital based on the recommendations of the review body i to apply a reduction in pay of 8 for those with salaries from to 12 for those earning between to 200,000 and 15 for those earning more than 200,000 these are reductions that in time will be in pension entitlements the salary of the taoiseach will be reduced by 20 this reduction together with the pension levy means the taoiseach's salary will be cut by close to 30 in total ministers and general of departments will take a pay cut of 15 or an overall cut of close to 25 when the pension levy is taken into account the review body that the it from a reduction in pay had it not been so the review body would have considered a adjustment for the same reason the pension levy was not to the although many have an amount on a basis the and the of the have all to make the pension contribution i will make provision in the finance bill to these payments since the review body would have considered a reduction of salaries i have decided that there will be no increase in pay during the of this government future may as in the past to continue this course of action those at the top will lead by example in this national of pay legislation to give effect to these substantial reductions in level pay will be published shortly i the review body for its work the report will be published later this week it must be that public servants have already made a very substantial contribution to the necessary reduction in public expenditure the pension levy has reduced their pay by an average of nearly their numbers have been reduced by the the early retirement scheme and breaks like many workers they have pay increases more is required the country can no afford a pay and pensions bill that for more than a third of all day to day expenditure any reduction in the pay bill must be sustainable must be in a progressive and must address the position beyond 2010 as the house there were with the public service unions in recent weeks the government to achieve the necessary reductions by agreement and the unions to a deal i the public service unions for the need to reduce the public service pay bill and for their and to an agreement on how this would be done a deal was not possible the reductions we must now make do not any lack of recognition of public servants or of the quality of the work they do for all of us they are simply a matter of necessity in these difficult times the pay of public servants will be reduced with effect from 1 january 2010 by a reduction of 5 on the first 30,000 of salary a reduction of on the next of salary and a reduction of 10 on the next of salary the reductions range from 5 to 8 in the case of salaries of public servants of up to the pay of members of these houses will be reduced in line with that of the equivalent public service provision for these reductions will be in legislation that i will shortly in order to a rate of retirement among older public servants the pension entitlements of those in 2010 will not be affected i the of the commission on taxation that pension below 200,000 should not be the of above this level and the tax of pensions including the rate of relief will be considered in the government's national pensions to be published shortly by the minister for social and family affairs public service pension reform exchequer spending on public service pensions will be over 2 billion in 2010 as life and the this cost is set to rise the pensions bill will grow from approximately 5 to of gdp by with two of the increase in spending going on social welfare pensions and the on public service pensions cost increases on this scale cannot be by any government determined to secure our economic future the government has decided to introduce a new single pension scheme for all new to the public service the legislation will be introduced in 2010 and the scheme will be in place by the end of the year the new scheme will bring public service pension terms more in line with private sector among other things it will change the of benefits so that pensions are based on average earnings rather than salary on retirement as at present this will be more than the present system which those with higher earnings later in their the minimum pension age for new public servants will also be increased from to and then to increases in the state pension age more details of the main of the new scheme are given in the of budget measures the to earnings or pay basis for post retirement pension increases is a feature of irish public service schemes the recent special report by the and general estimated that the present cost of these pensions is billion a change to a basis for post retirement increases would reduce that cost to billion a reduction of 20 on average pay increases have been greater than increases in the consumer price as part of the reform of public service pension i will review the current and consider pensions to increases in the cost of living that review i do not to apply the pay cuts i have already to existing public service pensioners these are significant changes the government is determined to meet the fiscal problems ireland and at the same time to make far for the future adjustments in social welfare the government is proud of its in increasing the level of social welfare payments over the past 12 years we have increased pension rates by approximately unemployment benefits by almost and child benefit payments by over the cost of living has increased by about 40 over the same period we and increased entitlements such that the level and extent of social support payments has been beyond recognition we are determined where possible to that progress in terms but we can either the generous system we have by making these savings now or we can put it all at risk by it beyond what resources will allow we did not reduce welfare rates in supplementary budget but i that rates of payment might be reduced if the cost of living the overall cost of living has by about over the past 12 months including very in the prices of the of food and in the case of working age rates of payment there will be a reduction of about unemployment among the young is a particular to the government we want to encourage them to stay close to the labour market while at the same time providing a rate of that very well particularly with payments in and ireland we know from the experience of the 1980s how a welfare system out of step with labour costs in the rest of the economy can people in that is why we are making the following targeted changes for new the rate of job allowance and supplementary welfare allowance for aged 20 and years of age who have no children is being reduced to 100 per week and for those aged between 22 and to 150 per week and for all other cases the rate will be reduced to 150 per week where job or measures have been in making adjustments to social welfare rates we that consumer prices have not at the same rate for all older people have experienced by far the reduction in living costs for that reason and in recognition of the contribution they have made to the state the government has decided to leave the state pension child benefit in the supplementary budget i raised the issue of the of paying the same level of child benefit of the level of income of the not only is this unfair but it is also in current circumstances child benefit this year will cost billion or 12 of total social welfare spending i had to be able to introduce greater equity by making child benefit or means but there are and reasons i cannot do so at this for that reason the government has decided to make the changes on the spending side the lower and higher rate of child benefit will be reduced by per month bringing these rates to 150 and per month welfare families will be fully by increasing the child allowance by per week so that they will not be affected by this measure low income families in of family income will be also fully the of budget measures gives further details of these and a number of other more limited changes on social welfare entitlements social welfare spending in 2009 to billion the measures announced today will reduce social welfare spending by million in 2010 this reduction social welfare spending will billion next year due to the rise in unemployment during 2009 of the major adjustments i am announcing today across all areas of spending welfare is making the contribution as a result of these rates of payment will to 2006 levels in the case of child benefit and just below 2008 levels in the case of working age rates for those aged 25 and over it is the government's to the generous level of social provision we have in this country but we are in very difficult circumstances and everyone must make a contribution government is about taking decisions taking responsibility and making choices that not all will welcome cutting public spending in the is easy where cuts will fall in reality is an different matter those have the of the former we have the of the adjustments in day to day spending over the last year we have been running to still in terms of spending on public services reductions have been by increases due to increased unemployment and higher debt costs in this budget

stimulate employment and protect the environment our plan is working we have turned the corner i this budget to the house
this budget should not be happening today it is happening however because fianna fáil failed to the and this economy on to the even now the thinking behind this budget is short it is us into a cycle of more job and higher debt people will after this budget people who had no hand or part in creating the problem that we now face this is a and a budget it no vision that would rebuild confidence it only to get the taoiseach and his ministers to the end of this week the only way to break out of the cycle that has been created is with a jobs strategy and that strategy is simply this real leadership from government we that sort of real leadership 50 years ago from and who offered a clear vision of how ireland could be different who had the and the courage to take action to interests to confront problems with vision such vision is from their that is the we face today many will the force of this budget them down none however will the that it will put the country back on its we expected to hear ministers lead by example the cut of 15 in ministers pay and 20 in the taoiseach's pay is a it the 10 we were told they were taking in april the truth is that the real cut ministers are taking is 5 by someone earning in the public service is expected to take a bigger cut than ministers those on social welfare with two children are expected to take a bigger cut than ministers this is a we are still to hear from the minister what anglo irish bank will out of next budget an issue on which he has people are this budget with and they are about the that were not and the that failed to address problems they are at the that this and that no one has been to account for the that have brought us to this they are for their and the of their children they expected to see in the budget the start of a real an to politics to our economy and public service all with the purpose of creating jobs that is what people expected and they have been by what we have seen today instead of the minister taking the radical steps to an that this government has brought to a ordinary people are being told to get out and push that is not fair and is not to address the scale of the problems we now face the actions taken in today's budget will do more to this recession than to it once again we see the minister go back to the old of investment not only this year and last year but next year and the following year we have never seen an economy come out of by investment the sort of investment that should be creating infrastructure for a modern age the minister is back and that infrastructure to be the minister is to confront the cost problems that are business down where is the radical to cut prsi on employers to give those employers who are on by their a to and to see out this christmas in the hope of something better in the new year the minister has failed those employers the minister is also the credit problem is and up a review the people did not want to hear that they to see action that would the credit situation the banks came in here last week and told us the of money to nama would not make a cent of difference to of credit that is a that will strong businesses businesses that will be down by the failure of credit the minister is the challenges we face by an budget this budget is a for in this for the next year looking to the same people for the same the the family struggling on low income and the public servant on low income that is what the minister for finance has up today as a positive contribution the truth is that creating and employment should have been the be all and end all of this budget that is the challenge we have to face it would have been a far more to kennedy to have tried to emigration from this country than to come up with a of recognition in the past two years 12 of irish employment in business has 22 of people one in five have taken a cut in their working some of those job have hit people under the age of 30 these are the people who are the can of the bad management of this economy those young people are the building for the future we cannot afford to allow by the minister's those people fall to unemployment and emigration as in the past this budget is one where his courage has failed him he has to take on the challenge of a strong economy in ireland that could have been done by the type of policies our party has put forward a radical programme to bring in private money to invest in the we need to get out of the we are in we need a modern a strong system a modern water system and we need to put energy efficient systems into our housing and building these are things we need and the money is not there to provide them unless the minister a to drive it he has back and failed in that area that is the we should have seen the minister start to address the challenge of the competitiveness of ireland and that has failed he has offered the of the smart economy i heard him use such as these are that off the of ministers but the truth is that 40 of the water we out of the system we have 5 of the of our we to the potential of energy to countries that do not have a of what we have available to us that is a failure of vision it is possible for the minister to address those issues if he had the vision to do it but that vision has failed him we have to break out of this cycle in the public finances will not it the minister has made provision today for 4 billion in cuts but the 75,000 extra people he will be on the dole will cost billion in lost revenue the deficit he has that interest on the debt will rise by 2 billion next year that is billion of the 4 billion that he has people so hard to deliver has just been away we are in a cycle that we are not out of because the minister only the issue of the public finances and not the wider issue of the economic and how we rebuild our economic that has failed us in this budget the minister had to face up to the situation anglo irish bank the in the say that 6 billion will be needed for the bank during the course of this year where is that provided for in this budget one cannot it will come from it has to be provided for and we have to budget for it we have to know where it will come from and if it will be to the national debt it is not until the minister those issues at the end of this budget the minister will borrow close to last amount we will be funding an of our net current spending on on borrowing which is an figure that is what the minister has achieved having asked so many people to take pain by his own say that of our income tax will be in paying interest that is of the people make to pay income tax will be away that is a cycle the minister has to break but it can only be broken if he has a strategy to address economic growth the minister talks about having better economic growth and says the worst is over that is a like announcing when he went to the truth is that these numbers are he has not the that can bring us that growth create the employment opportunities give us the competitive and bring down costs that is the confidence is vital to our recovery people will not invest if they are and they are the minister has that next year private investment will fall by 40 a figure it that people are not the government has a strategy that will bring this economy on a road where they can see where they are and have a in what is being done we cannot break the cycle if investors and families do not have the confidence to go out and spend that is the position we are in one needs more than claims that the worst is over one needs to see action a strategy a plan that is the that has been left front line services have been hit hard in this budget because the minister was not willing to face up to the much more radical change by the mccarthy report that is the part of it the minister a report that that he address issues some were identified by the mccarthy process and not one of them has been taken on i that is not because in last budget the minister announced that there were to be 30 what happened half of them have not been the total savings to from those is million less than of the budgets involved the minister has failed to create the to make happen he has failed to move from where they are not needed to where they are needed he does not have a system for doing that and he does not have the to give the power to the way they do their business he has left it to the to try to address those changes we come back to this budget and see that the focus has been on the front line and not on the changes we should have seen these changes will be hard on people the minister is asking people on the scheme to pay per month at the last general election the amount was he is asking people on medical to pay 50 cent per in the when such a cost was introduced it the one third of the income do not decide what is on their medical decide that that on per week to the means are being asked to pay up to 10 per month will not save us on our drugs bill to do that one has to be radical about using drugs and look at new not asking the in our community to contribute the minister is asking carers who are saving the state a to take a cut of in the amount of money they receive where is the fairness in that he is asking widows and to take that cut simply because they are under the age of why were such people not the value of the work of a for which the minister will pay per week to per week that is what a means to a family and it does not mean simply a saving it means that the is in an environment in which he or she wants to be and getting the care they want the minister needed more imagination he has hit people who are down the fact that he has hit child payments is very short because young families have the of the recession they are the people who paid excess prices for houses in the and are now in negative equity some of them face there are families in negative equity and the minister's to them is it is where is the work of the government group that was address these problems we were told in the programme for government that this would be a but this has not been in the budget what other group is more important than families who are under of their homes we expected to see provision for them and we expected to see the needs of the of this recession the minister has provided for job for the who are out of work and this is welcome but far more welcome would be a radical economic plan to drive employment growth fine economic plan to do this to a potential of jobs after four years that is the sort of vision we needed the sort of commitment that was possible for the minister to take on he has short people who to have been at the heart of this budget time and again we have heard the former minister for finance deputy and again as taoiseach talking about the of reform in the public service we have heard all the but it has nothing today we see the evidence of this the mccarthy report set out cuts that could be achieved in the area of social welfare and there was a and a of from people who we would not be reduced to such action the report also looked at areas other than social welfare it considered in the spending system and in the minister has adopted none of the what is worse he has adopted of the savings on the social welfare side but only 25 in the social welfare areas this was the difficult area the area that required ministers to apply a of imagination to invest their in the way they their system to get more with less the minister that responsibility to make those and as a result it is the front line those low paid public servants who will pay from the very first euro it is people on social welfare under years who will pay the minister has asked them to up because he was not willing to confront the sort of change that is needed the government should have adopted each proposal in the mccarthy report as it came and be seen to be driving a programme from the down and with trade unions from the very start and announcing that this was part of a jobs strategy it should have for solidarity from all those working in the public service as well as the private sector in order to create an employment strategy instead the government has those and it has left us with the public service that is and this is a most people i talk to in the public service know that costs in the public service will need to be cut if we are to trade our way out and rebuild a strong economy that employment they know that but they want to be part of a strategy that shows solidarity with something bigger that is being created a real employment strategy the minister did not go to them with an employment strategy in which they could believe in which they could see that their was going to be to a bigger an of change not just in the public service but in the economy and the economy the minister went to them with a demand for pay cuts but where was the wider strategy to bring down costs where was the commitment to confront pay the off that we see in our shops every day where was the commitment to drive down prices to government charges where was the commitment to cut that are businesses by the day the minister needed to show that the effort he was asking for from public servants which was was by an equal to confront costs right across the economy we have of people in the sector who are not those costs and who are making businesses go to the if the minister could have people's support behind such a strategy they would but the minister the and the to take on those interest who have been too too close to government in the past this is what has let us down we have been left with cross between the public and the private sectors the public sector will never without a private sector and the private sector will never unless the public sector can be and become more effective we work together we needed a sense of and to confront these problems together and instead the minister has left a of and which is doing us no good it was vital that people should regard this budget as being fair we expected much more in terms of asking people who are better off to contribute to the cost fine gael proposed that those earning over 75,000 would pay the full 4 prsi levy all the way up but that was not adopted we proposed radical reform in pension relief targeted at the higher paid and that has not been adopted we proposed the out of many of the tax but that has not been adopted i agree the minister has adopted the and set a tax but the figures tell it all nothing will be achieved from that measure this year and even next year it will only be million we were a contribution of million contribution from the better off in our community that balance was needed and it has been however there is a greater in this budget where is the fairness in the way the banking crisis has been how could it be fair that those who created this problem still circle the and two to run those banks that brought us to our how can it be fair to ask the taxpayer to an extra billion in paying for these assets simply to protect the investors in these banks how can it be fair that good businesses are now because what the banks are doing is using the money the minister them to protect their interests not to rebuild a strong economy that is of the needs of small business they say that is what they are doing and that is what one would expect them to do unless the minister to make it different who is being brought to for all this that is what people ask me every day and i am sure they also ask the minister the same question who is being brought to for the things that were done in our banks no one has yet been brought to where is the change so that we can be sure that what happened in the past will not again we still do not see that change happening there is a at the heart of this government a in the of this system of that should be driving ireland to have a public sector at the heart of economic growth this is a time of opportunity for the public sector it assets that are vital to our recovery and it budgets that have to be it needs leadership in this budget and it has not happened changes have to start with politics and we have not seen that here we have not seen it in the way ministers are dealing with their own pay have we seen it in a to confront the fact that the has become too big fine gael has proposed getting of the and reducing the of the we should start by these houses as part of a bigger plan to reform the country this is the of the and economic plan for development things were very because then as now ireland had years of failed policies and then as now there were interests that did not want to see change however what happened then did not happen now then we had ministers who were willing to set out to be determined to confront change to take the actions that were necessary that is the sort of leadership we need again the government has failed to the moment i that because it is the of much of what has gone wrong it has spent too much time in too much time in and it was not its to have the courage to make the changes we need this budget has not to the economy to rebuild this country it has not to a modern public service that could rebuild the and quality public service that is needed for the future it has not to a social which people could believe in a social built around reform in our health system so that the two service could be a social around the pensions system so we would not have people as happened the workers in with nothing we need to see that thinking coming from the heart of government we need that sort of leadership history has us the of many who were too with themselves to keep up with technology and who were to who as if they were a modern way of what did they do they sent young people over the top into the of which them down in many ways we are in an economic our are our equipment is not modern and our have failed us we need real leadership from government at its what is wrong with this budget is that leadership has been it is further that those who got us into this do not have the ability to what they have broken they do not have the vision authority courage or policies
the other day a note about the irish budget which referred to the of in ireland about the necessity for budget adjustments i will one from the it states although the government the opposition and the trade unions continue to debate where and how the should fall there is little or no about when and how much the budget should be cut the minister had a available to him from the fine gael party and labour party as well as the trade union one could never have party such an start to any government this could have been a budget as it was a all together moment an opportunity for burden by everyone but the minister it the budget is out of the school of in which burden like taxation is only for the little people social welfare payments have been reduced by 8.30 per week for carers widows and aged under years parents people on and even blind people the minister has some ted kennedy the of the poor and fairness in who like and bill was not to say that rich people in a republic should pay their fair share of tax he estimates the contribution from the wealthy will be million or approximately of the total budget adjustment package of 4 billion that is the fairness and burden in the budget it is the with two children working in the public services who will the of the burden although she will be to have a job as i am sure the minister will not stop her the minister the national management or banks last month we had the establishment of nama which was in many ways the of the who and by the fianna fáil party the economy to today we have the of the this morning i heard ask to suggest for a christmas hit single fianna hit single for christmas will be i nama parents should know that child benefit is being cut to pay for the of the banks and developers that is where the is in the budget the government had to borrow billion extra this year 4 billion of which was given to anglo irish bank while 3 billion from the national pensions reserve fund was given to the two banks let us not be under any the at the the is the of the banks and developers i am the minister came into the house with his between his and the increase in vat the single most disastrous action he took in the early budget for 2009 his half point vat sent over the border to queue in in and in the minister also reduced excise on alcohol and introduced a scheme for the details of the budget in reports i that the minister's decision to cut the cost of drink and his budget a kind of top budget for of which would it is not that these measures will not as a stimulus it is that budgets are about choices and the minister to impose the burden of pain on families with children and those on social welfare aged under years as i stated the burden introduced in the taxation measures for the higher paid to less than of the total 4 billion adjustment it is a time for parents of young and in many the of the minister's pre budget was his that unemployment would increase by a further 75,000 next year employment in agriculture has whole of nurses all of whom were at cost to the state have to work in hospitals in the and and civil teachers construction are it to find jobs at home if this is the of those with how much worse is it for the early school and young unemployed person this is a for the individuals affected and their families and no less a for the whole country history us the that unemployment and unemployment among people aged under 25 years its last a and economic recovery does not guarantee that the will be employment must be the main focus of policy the labour party the 4 billion adjustment so as to protect our international credit and make the cost of borrowing as as possible we an additional billion in our to allow for a jobs initiative the minister is so with banks at any cost that he cannot face the jobs and employment challenge that should his night and day a great many young of said today many young and will say after christmas because they must take the decision to leave as people all over ireland and every and know is this the the minister wants from his time in office the minister claims to have a smart economy strategy where is it now a full year after its he enormous energy and resources to protecting the property economy through nama but has not a of that energy to the knowledge economy where are the that can offer a for young and if a person unemployed for a long period it is difficult to him or her in the labour force when the recession two or three years later if they are to secure job experience on will take up the opportunities to experience when the recession is over the way the minister is young unemployed people is a real problem and the measures in the budget today touch the of the issue i to child benefit the minister this issue very well and has decided to make this cut in respect of and children the and the heart of his strategy from the reduction in public service pay i the day early in may 2007 when the deputy called an election the minister deputy brian lenihan had an early morning job to do it was a morning in may 2007 the child benefit payment day but there would be no ordinary payment that day it would be a payment day the the other brian the then minister for finance deputy had made a special budget day that child benefit was to increase in 2007 by 10 per month per child this would not happen and mothers would have to wait for several months they would have to wait until may to get the increase which by would be the election month in the post office queue in were looking forward to a payment and to make the day extra special there was the then minister of state with responsibility for children deputy brian lenihan along the queue and i am about that part of it as i did not see him doing that and everyone that fianna fáil was the party that looked after child benefit it would be something for them to remember on election day some weeks later and they did so that day in may 2007 the minister deputy brian lenihan was top of the post office today what has the minister to say to those mothers i can the minister deputy brian lenihan that are not that it was the same five years the minister and other fianna fáil deputies could to citizens over years that they would get medical that the minister to power in the general election later he he could and with those people but as it turned out that was not the case it will not be the case with either but we will have to wait and see might think about this matter at some and let us see what they decide to do i hear shops are doing a trade in single this christmas with a possible election next year one never when a might come in to deal with who break their the minister should ask about it i have of by people who that child benefit payments are of little including and who it would make no difference if the payment were most of these were by none of whom could state that he spoke for his or i have yet to meet a of young or children who says that child benefit has no to her i do not in where this benefit is a certainly i do not a constituency that no value on the of universal child benefit almost every day i hear the of on for the community as i am sure everyone here does she us that the current crisis has brought community services to point i hear the same message from of the society of st are these societies is the community its message this christmas is the society of st out of touch are they saying social welfare in ireland is so generous that it can be cut i have yet to hear a person who is in touch with ordinary families in the community who will say up front that social welfare in the ireland of 2009 is generous and to be cut the minister deputy lenihan should note that in this budget he looked for and he child benefit is a option he the recipients of social welfare are the minister had a choice there are thousands of tax exiles in ireland wealthy individuals they of their to and good that is all very but in a republic it is no for paying fair share of income tax i welcome the measure but i note the very of the to the of a levy on tax exiles we will know more when we examine the finance bill there are poor bankers them struggling through the business with the of 500,000 per year they do not have to contribute extra as a result of this budget in so far as i figure it i am not aware of from where their extra contribution comes the minister deputy lenihan had a simple choice today of who to face down would it be the tax exiles the poor bankers on only 500,000 per year or the mothers of ireland he made the choice and it says a good deal about the minister his and his child benefit has been a the most vulnerable group of children out of poverty i fianna fáil on past increases in child benefit as does everyone in the opposition child benefit has in children out of poverty because there was no means ireland did away with tax for children many ago universal child benefit has been the policy to help families with children and the recognition by society that raising children financial support and recognition by the government as members are aware in the tax a person with two children pays the same tax as a person with no children a family or couple with three children pays the same tax as a couple with no children however we children and the cost to their parents of them through child benefit i am that every time in the recent of budget adjustments and measures that the minister to on children the minister increased he down the building of schools he support for child care he for education we know that during all the years of our we in one child in every five who in poverty in ireland out of that poverty from just below the poverty line to just above it that is an important in this country because we are not a very equal society income is very high up and there are very many people at very low levels of income why did the minister a those who social welfare cuts have it back to front instead of cutting social benefits we should protect them for those at the bottom of the benefit scale in this crisis because it is universal and efficient social welfare an in a recovery strategy this is by people in the and the reserve in the states social welfare spending in european economies is a stimulus package that people on the very bottom to be able to spend today the minister has cut their spending power across a significant the of 8 a week does not too much to people in this house but it is an to a a 4 cut in child benefit does not too much in this house but it is an to people who are and as the of their shopping to their children when one goes shopping one can see the in different who has the and who has the and the up in the it is not a good day for the people with the let us not that it is it will be tough on them they will have to make hard choices about their children protecting benefits is simple direct and progressive it is a efficient way to poverty and sustain power for the vulnerable in our reducing benefits will save money a of the budget that million of the 4 billion cut is from the social welfare package and approximately 500 million has been cut from education those are the that are taking the of today's cuts it cannot be good for the economy that the minister has cut power and it is certainly not good for the health of our society at this point one that me about the minister is that he to be by economic that comes from the right he is a man but he to a right wing view of society and recovery i to think the the that is coming at us day in day out is from the same people who on the building boom for years and the early of a banking collapse i cannot understand why so many in this country the of stimulus why are many european economies some modest of recovery while to behind the minister the fianna fáil that on his ireland would be the first country out of recession that has not happened and it is not going to happen why are we still in deep recession with growth it is because the government's policies are very much at with the by many others countries that have money into consumer demand and public projects the government has to give our money to banks in the hope that some of it through to the general economy and to businesses and enterprises down that old of the right wing it has not done so and there is no of any change in bank policies good to the new set up by the minister we with mr and mr for several approximately two weeks ago and they on every single demand from deputies on all about credit flow mr was the most because he is close to retirement he just said that it is not going to happen all that has happened is that bank debt has been into taxpayer debt with effect on our debt capacity all around ireland businesses are businesses need but need confidence to get out and spend confidence is the most but most vital of economic policy one cannot it or buy it and there is little in today's budget that will any of confidence into the households of this country i am sure the taoiseach is aware of an fact namely that there are savings in this country of billion the savings have been up just like in in its lost and in for a long period which is where much of our credit came from did not want to buy new and the did not want to buy new at all we are doing now what they did we are saving more as a result have going to shops people are about the future they have going to shops in the republic because they know they are being off for example on the rate there is in shopping and shopping in and its and in around the country people around the shops but one very few shopping in years at christmas time people were down with shopping if one over to one will see only one or two with big the budget to have been at those people let us if just 10 or 20 of those savings that are building up were for spending into the economy it would the minister's take from vat and other taxes however the budget had just one focus and that was just too for the times we live in the economy certainly needs the by fianna fáil ministers for finance into our economic has made a necessity but the needs as well as to a full recovery today's budget is strong on but on i wish to address the issue of fairness and tax fianna fáil made a decision today not to in any way change the tax burden to a limited on high income earners fairness is probably the most vital that can people in the challenge we face to restore national fairness the minister's package will more than ever we need a one ireland a one nation vision that can demand burden on the understanding that it is by all in to their ability to take the pain i have been by the of public sector in recent weeks in which ministers have if there is to be a they want to have someone in the line they have let the of on every public why should the private sector go down this it is private sector businesses who benefit most from public spending it is private businesses that build the schools the hospitals and services to the state the state is the biggest of private business the to the public sector is no great help to business in a way it is the hand that one if one cuts public funds it is private business that the biggest hit let us make no we are all in this together the government that our people at a time of crisis does not to i said in the house recently that there was a to be from the process nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and we all together the all is one of the in the it means the public sector every and every it means the in the and it means the well paid in the banks and industry it means those who did well from the boom years of whom there are many did the budget ask a fair amount of from all those people i do not think it did many of the tax remain in place a feature from a recent of the business post a home scheme in county it is in a part of the county however the focus of the feature is not the but the tax breaks that come with the there is no there of any let up in the of this and other of breaks that so our tax of its progressive and fairness the reports of the revenue still tell of high earners with low effective tax rates the in the 2006 budget only the i welcome the further today however i the house of what mr in the the business post last a of those who were tax reliefs many of them to property that the 500,000 income group that is to who each have an income of 500,000 or more had increased their tax contribution but just to the 20 per cent the minister has proposed to increase that by another 10 but as he said at the start of his contribution the rate of tax on the average civil servant or private sector who above in the case of a single person is approximately and their average rate of tax is much higher than what the minister is today it is an when these people call for low taxes they mean simply no taxes if we take the relief for pensions we had and from the last week on this which a billion cost for this on its own that is billion per year in tax reliefs for pensions deputies should know that the top 20 of earners take two of all the pension tax reliefs a goes to the bottom 20 of earners we allow a pension to go as high as billion in the it is less than half of that why not reduce the to 3 million it would still be very generous we allow tax free up to million that could be at or 200,000 the identified savings of 500 million the labour party did not go that far in its pre budget plan we suggest a yield from savings reductions for the people at the very top of million as long as these tax remain such a feature of tax policy the of tax will remain a the measures taken so far to this have been half in the and this approach has been repeated in today's budget this government has no to lose but it has choices to make tax decisions are always hard to make hard choices that ministers to make but which they never stop the minister for finance many of the hard choices today one of the difficulties is that our economy is the worst recession most people have ever experienced or i hope will ever experience it is already worse than the 1980s and it is not over yet certainly not in this country the measures adopted by the european central bank and other central banks have so far off a full from recession into total that might change if the a line on credit or on interest rates it could also change if we go too down the road that the minister has out today the of cutting back on everything in is to push the country into a that is a for unemployment social poverty and living standards the behind this budget has the potential to push our economy into a of above all there is no clear message of hope from this budget for the hundreds of thousands of people on the live register and the 75,000 additional people who fianna fáil plan to have on the live register next year taxes are down and the deficit is out of hand what does government do it cuts spending power in the economy even more spend less and less by cutting welfare payments and child benefit families have less to spend and tax further that is the and it this budget like the of mr we have an economic crisis on our we have an unemployment crisis and we have a credit however this minister is dealing with these as national debt and banking that is too a focus there is a in called who two to the world looking in at the same time this government is like one face to be the and of the wealth the budget and coming to with a new financial reality then we have the face the of a that brought this country to and this has to be and out at any price the minister every under the to the cost from citizens of the of his we have nama special purpose vehicles off balance and direct of capital with no of return the national pensions reserve fund has been to support the and annual interest payments on the money to hundreds of millions this is the cost we the people must pay in the hope of getting this back to business as before this set of ministers has no no vision of an economic that has a focus other than the of this small group back to the place it had before that is the real face on here today the government the country much for the benefit of this group now it the budget to pay the cost of the up and restore the to its position it cost us 4 billion to anglo irish bank in 2009 money we had to borrow and pay interest on the interest cost in 2010 for the 4 billion for anglo irish bank will probably be as high as million that is almost as much as the amount to be raised in cutting child benefit another way to look at the cut in child benefit is to say that it is just to pay the interest on the anglo irish bank of 4 billion in 2009 we know from reports today that there will be more borrowing for this bank and other banks we hear the banks could need another billion from the state next year billion for for bank of ireland and 2 billion for irish building society which is a building society we are taking 8 billion in and we are talking about 2 billion into a building society which was to help people get mortgages to a home it is all told the taxpayer could be on the for a 15 billion over the next two years to fianna strategy for the banks this nama breaks even and does not become a billion euro on the taxpayer each year the what may be the face about nama is only for the first few months to the first year of its these numbers put today's budget in the place the minister should not there is no between the of anglo irish bank and the budget crisis we face that is at the heart of his budget strategy it has those two one is the for every citizens including social welfare recipients and public servants and the other is the to the of developers to the taxpayer the bond market and not the eu commission will make the call on our national bond investors are fully aware of government borrowing under every a euro is a euro no matter how it is the issue for bond investors is the risk of borrowing to up a bank a higher risk than borrowing for the government should think about that in the past few months the government has on an chamber of to make its case in the this chamber has out the of who to make a case for a different approach to economic recovery it is not in a society to have only one set of repeated day in day out as truth we are paying a price for this to happen in the boom years when all went out the and any got short and when a taoiseach the option to who did not like what was happening in our country the chamber the same namely there is no alternative it is the only in we are where we are and the will get us we hear these repeated and any from the line is out of hand we experienced it in the debate on the bank guarantee and when we hear the green out by fianna fáil we know something is so it in the case of the anglo irish bank which has cost us so much in and let us have no more of this cuts are not the only option for national recovery and there is a case for stimulus and an alternative to nama it is time to the case for as a major force in policy societies that value and promote it in their economies have best and the evidence has been over 30 years and published in the past year it better health a better quality of life better a better sense of and well being this budget does nothing to make ireland a more equal society it goes in the wrong it will increase confidence and damage social solidarity its economic may well be and its social certainly will be i that the labour party down this budget in the at the back of the budget we have and one of whom is a civil servant and the other is a house they face a cut in their pay of a year or approximately 50 per week in this example there a child in the pre school age group so they are with a from the government of nearly in a second example of and their are a year which is over 50 per week or 4 of their income there is no adjustment at the end of the scale many civil servants are willing to make but the that wants to hear is about fairness those who have the most should bear a share of the burden that they are better to it is a budget for carers the cut of 8.30 a week in respect of them does not mean an to many in here because deputies are well paid and we can take our share of any cuts imposed on us i sorry for people like carers and widows i know the mccarthy report that widows to have it easy but many widows particularly widows do not have it that easy the reduction of 8.30 a week will come hard to them on top of a reduction of 4 per week in child benefit for each child
we have heard it now so the worst is over as we have been told by the minister for finance he did not say for whom the worst is over it may well be over for the bankers and the circle of protected by the government the worst is not over for the almost 500,000 people on the live register it is not over for those people who are living through the worst every day and struggling to keep families together and buy and food for them these are people who have lost their job in the construction sector or who were involved in small businesses the worst is not over for them i did the taoiseach or his ministers speak with real people to find out what the worst is in this state have they spoken to people in around the state from to to and to to find out what is the worst for them the worst is not over for those people have members of the government spoken to people in ireland about how even as we speak they are to to with children or going to meet so that their children can go to find the jobs which the government has to be in this state have they spoken to parents who are about and into and because of the currently experienced where is the hope for them and when will the worst end for them the government has told us it is too to bring in a taxation system to those people earning more than a week or it is too to tax reliefs i meet people all the time particularly in recent months who are widows who have or who have lost jobs and businesses they wish it could be too for the government to cut their welfare income such as the per week or the christmas of course that is not too and it can be the government is ordinary workers and the unemployed to try to get the last few cent from their pockets it is unfair the government is driving people into poverty and into the of money it is driving people to the of the society of st this budget goes against young people who are the highest rates of unemployment in any sector young who took out mortgages and homes in the past few years are now significant negative equity but the government has them again in this budget by cutting child benefit young people have been that if they do not take part in education and training social welfare payments will be cut some of those young people have spent three four or five years in education some have are or are well but there are no jobs for them one of the reasons for this is the government by without any stimulus package and those jobs to across the state no job fund was put in place and there was stimulus package to try to deal with the reality we were told banks had to saved and that was the poor i will the other measures which have been introduced the minister is and trying to us as well funding for primary schools has been by which will have some effect on schools across the state we should think of how will try to manage on 20 less when they were already struggling in their economic position before this budget this budget has targeted cuts at and funding for education for the is to be cut by we should think for a moment about this impact on one of the most sectors in society that is nothing short of the drugs force funding is to be cut by 11 i meet people involved in such in my constituency in and and they need all the help they can get if this funding is cut people will be off the scheme and back into a cycle of drugs and to sustain the it will cost the state more in the long run as there will be cases and pensioners being in their homes and the government it is to cut those by 11 these cuts show us that the poor are being made to pay the highest price for fianna the 11 reduction in the local government will have for the provision of local service service charges and rates will be up again low income families than those who are off the proposed changes to the prsi for 2011 will see any taken from the system we need a general election and allow the people decide if this government has the capacity to the state it does not have a for what it is doing in over 54 billion to the banking sector and 4 billion in particular to a bank in anglo irish bank this is this should not be going on the government has no to do it if the taoiseach had the courage of his he would have put the nama proposal to the people and let them decide there should always have been a on nama in any this budget is the economic equivalent of an man when he is down the economy is on the and along come the of fianna fáil to give it another good going over this budget will poverty and driving our economy into recession because of the and short of fianna fáil and its partners in the green party the huge budget deficit is a result of the irish economic recession which was caused by their disastrous policies and the deficit is the not the the minister has to the in the most while doing nothing about the this recession is as much one of as it is of resources over the past two years the taoiseach us to the of economic and today he us over it i have one hope for this budget that it will as a up call for the people over the past 12 months we as a people have the government a of jobs from the levies and social welfare cuts in april to the 54 billion nama off it is that the taoiseach could not stay to hear the rest of my contribution because i am sure it would have been for him the government has been by of the and by fine gael and the labour party in people that the of this budget is necessary but it is not there was another way but we could never expect fianna fáil to take us the fair it caused the problems in the first place this budget was an opportunity to show some vision even now it is not too to put ireland on the road to recovery it is not beyond us to stimulate this economy a programme for jobs an investment in people and a commitment to protect the most vulnerable as we turn everything around is all possible sinn féin has shown that it is possible our pre budget the road to recovery considered by like and by the department of finance here was an alternative to what the minister has done a way in which to money through bringing fairness to an unfair and taxation system cutting state to the private sector and the among high earners and by the government the minister has shown us that fianna fáil and the are still to the fiscal policies of to save 4 billion from the deficit the government has shown itself willing to further low income families the cuts to social welfare will in ireland already one of the most states in the oecd the cuts to education make a of our so called knowledge economy will the minister how we can build a knowledge economy in and and with it equipment the cuts to health services will be the difference between life and for thousands of people across this and that is no a charge for medical is it the of free health care for those most in need and though the charge may low the worst hit will be those most on once introduced it will be increased year on year the minister and the government are like in reverse in that they are the poor to give to the rich shame on each and every one of them worse still the minister has made sure recovery will take than it should because he has hit the of the economy he has hit the in an economy on taxes and he has hit the education system the building for a for a party that has long itself on its ability to manage the economy fianna fáil has itself with this budget had the minister made even one tough decision for example the of a third tax rate tax reliefs the pay of high end civil servants he would have saved and the state many tough decisions next year he has done any by going after the easy targets in this budget such as welfare recipients and low income families his half of pay cuts for and a small number the highest earners do not go far enough in terms of what they should contribute to get the economy up and running their high salaries to the deficit not the payments to social welfare recipients his failure to see this has only and the it is essential that we a fair taxation system in this state we will have to review the spent on tax reliefs we will have to put an end to the state up private banks and the government's schemes for debt and in addition we will have to address the economic of and the damage it is doing to the potential of both of this island fianna fáil and the green party have shown themselves of tackling any of these issues and they have had more than enough the reality is that i have little in fine gael or the labour party the affairs much better both parties have into the government's analysis of the economy and provided their own proposals for cutting social welfare public spending and workers pay all of this can be expected from fine gael on any given day but the labour party has to the right itself to get into with fine gael it would from its pre budget that the labour party is jobs but towards the labour leadership is by the of annual their former trade union in the in these times when real will be required every in this state should be aware that fianna fáil and the green party with fine gael and the labour party will make no difference to economic recovery the minister for the environment heritage and local government is in agreement fine gael and the labour party would implement the same policies in a different package with the same bad for the economy while the establishment parties close and a in their policies we are the only party that up for working people whether they are in jobs or not we are because we are the only party with an alternative analysis of the situation we address the problems in the economy with the of reducing the deficit the other parties set out proposals to reduce the deficit without ever dealing with the problems of the economy with this i will what the minister for finance has to the house and to the country i will examine the areas where he to and and how it could have been done and a better result i hope the people at home will and decide from the to the debate who they would rather have introducing the next budget when the minister introduced the budget in april last he stated the economy would need to by a further 4 billion over the course of 2010 and he would set out how that figure would be raised and saved in this budget which he has done the in the is that in april the 4 billion was planned as an adjustment to a much deficit of approximately 20 billion the fall in tax revenue over the last months means the deficit is wider now yet he still a 4 billion adjustment is necessary and other parties agree why is 4 billion needed why should we believe the minister when he has go it wrong up to now the european commission has had to the period for economic recovery offered to the government by a year his plan has before it has even for a stimulus package we believe a stimulus package and investment in the economy would not only confidence at home but also abroad the government can that it international investors are well to its to spending but in reality international investors can see a government the the department of are by the month as are exchequer this does not confidence the rest of the world is to economic with stimulus the response of the government and the opposition parties other than us is to return to the right wing economic policies of the 1980s they are determined to make this situation worse and see us more years before recovery our pre budget proposals would more than billion our figures were to stimulate the economy not to it our tax raising measures were at high earners to ensure they did not hit the spending power of the and lower earners let me be clear that by high earners i mean individuals not households earning in excess of 100,000 people on incomes below that were from our that thinking is in the government's strategy for fiscal adjustment and it is every measure taken over the past 12 months has further the economy this budget will be no different the minister has taken 4 billion out of the economy in the most way the that will be out in 2010 will be more job further in property prices and revenue and we know that all this will happen because we have seen it happen throughout history the minister also this will happen so his budget today can only be seen in one he is recovery because he wants to protect the circle in the state for a period he is also determined to protect those in the circle the very high earning households that is why he has taken these and measures such as cuts to social welfare a sinn féin from other parties in the state as we see social welfare as a right and not a payment that can be cut at will on the economic climate families on it for their food and for they have no other income when the government is those people it is essential they have this minimum for food and some level of in this budget there was much talk about the need to reduce the social welfare bill the government and some have towards the social of this state not once in all the talk about the social welfare bill was made to the of reducing social welfare spend by people in jobs and creating new jobs instead the focus was on rates of pay and the was made by fianna fáil the green party the leader of which has us in the chamber other establishment parties and some in the that per week is too much for people to live on i wish some ministers would try to on per week for a few weeks to see how they get on then they would get a of reality and would what people are going through what type of people think it is to take money off someone on a week but not from someone earning in excess of a week we do have problems in our social welfare system there is and involved the system is a all of this has increased under the government's there is no area its have not into and however the problems in social welfare that end up the state extra money should be dealt with and rates of payment should not be cut cutting social welfare payments will have a effect on the economy and society social welfare payments are always to the economy on a basis they are not saved or invested abroad they are spent on mortgages food and other cutting welfare expenditure is a economy and one that will only for those on the end of the policy we do not the of in of welfare cuts the fall in the cost price this year mortgage interest a number of have not in price they have increased and they target the less well off the cost of child care primary and school education hospital services and have all increased and no one on the other side of the house has this these costs make a of the that people on social welfare and low wages can afford to live on less we have already seen the of cuts made to social welfare payments this christmas the loss of the christmas a payment which affected million people is money that would have been spent in our shops on the high on and christmas food the government's measures will come back to it when it its vat at the end of this month and will see a substantial reduction it will also have an effect on the retail sector increasing the number of job and more people social welfare the rate of job allowance by age further to the measures taken in the supplementary budget 2009 is an of power by the government and shows just how out of touch it is the proposal to reduce the rate of social welfare to 100 and 150 a week for those between 20 and which a cut of 25 what should be the main focus of economic recovery which is getting ireland back to work the social welfare bill should be reduced by those people the opportunity that they want they do not want to about their homes or from family and they want to go back to work and the government is doing nothing to deliver this against young in their welfare entitlements is unfair it is necessary to this in terms rather than from a top down young people after three four or five years of education there is a on public sector employment little if any employment in the private sector and they have most debt during the course of their many of these young are on the they may not have for a local authority and as such would have through they are now expected to come out of and live on 150 a week ministers should try it some time and let us know how they get on the cuts are if there was any in this world all members on the other side of the house would lose their jobs in the next election and then we would hope to see them live on those the measures taken on child benefit will do nothing to the economy they are further evidence of a approach the government's to leave any social provision protected from its child benefit is a universal payment made to every child in the state in recognition that every child is equal and that the state children with nothing after they turn six weeks old when free health care for children in this state when children are six weeks old the state away and they are left without child care without the financial ability in many cases for their parents to stay at home and without a fully education system the minister for finance every child in the state today and i hope he is proud of it the cuts to the public sector pay bill offer another approach to this recession in our pre budget proposals we identified savings in the public sector pay bill we identified those savings by the pay of individuals earning more than 100,000 per annum that is a salary for people in the public sector deputies ministers and should have their salaries to the same how can the state afford to pay any civil servant in excess of 100,000 a year when as deputy told the week in politics programme recently the is down our because of the the public finances are in these people need to get real if one into account his last year for helping to run the health service into the that is times higher than the salary of a civil servant at the minister deputy used to social when he was on this side of the house deputy and his party there and with this situation if his party is not with the current position it should that this is the case and it should leave government and give the people what they need namely the of a general election in order that the country might some form of leadership the government and some opposition parties are of the view that workers and office workers should all bear the pain for this recession in equal measure to the government's cuts do not this instead they look at pay across the and it its cut of a further 5 in addition to the pension levy on people earning below 30,000 is a pay cut of per annum these individuals already their budgets to full capacity when they to out home additional for their children or whatever they have made which they must and the government is now its hand into their pockets and taking away from them at a time when they cannot afford it when they cannot alternative employment in order to improve their circumstances or when they have no of part time work in order to their incomes the government is them of per week shame on the minister those on a year will lose it is that in its pre budget proposal sinn féin that incomes below 75,000 should remain the only we would have imposed on people with earnings above that amount would be to the prsi the real would have been 100,000 in respect of which we would have introduced a new tax of why did the minister not to what we had to say in that regard when he was on this side of the house he policies why did the green party collapse into the of fianna fáil and go along with the whole approach to running this state what has happened in this regard is what will be the long term of government policy in this regard it has taken away the spending power of a group whose members we need to spend their money in order to turn the economy around it wants people who have 2009 costs to live on wages it has achieved the of mccarthy and of driving down the of living and the of the however it has done little to encourage economic recovery as already stated sinn pre budget proposals would have in raising and saving in excess of billion a good deal of which would have come from simply introducing more fairness to the taxation system there are some measures in the budget the tax on exiles does not go far enough the raising of the effective tax rate goes some way towards what is necessary but again this will not be nearly enough in the overall scheme of things there are no wealth taxes or third rate of income tax in the budget in addition the prsi has not been abolished what will be the benefit of the universal contribution at its low rate for high earners the government and its have a great deal of in respect of why taxation is i believe none of it there is still a great deal of in the taxation system on one hand the government us that it cannot afford to increase taxes on the other hand however it is all and that ireland a low tax economy and that the is one of the government's which statement is this is nothing of which to be proud we have a 22 billion deficit and the government is still to create a fair taxation system we must stimulate the economy and to do that further revenue will be required taxation cannot continue to be and the government cannot continue to our low taxation economy as being job if the is then where are the jobs why have we a position of i wish to the low taxes at the top are not the economy and for the of workers at the bottom is not a low tax the bottom rate of income tax is low but there is a huge of taxation and a lack of service provision that ireland for this group a very high tax economy these are the people who should not be for more tax however the government is determined to have it both ways high taxes at the bottom and low taxes at the top such a system is not sustainable the government will have no option but to address the in the tax system the commission on taxation identified tax reliefs that between them pay back almost as much as is taken in income tax many of these reliefs are by high earners the minister is in agreement he will what he has done about this i am not a of the but he is could he not have more in respect of some kind of fairness in the taxation system does he not that people throughout the country and not those in his constituency expect that of him what is is that the green party did not in respect of this budget there is no in the system ireland has two tax while most other countries have between three and five are we of a fair and progressive taxation system or is it a lack of political will to ensure those at the top pay their fair share the government claims that there is in the tax system there is no in the system for those earning over 75,000 if one can pay less tax the higher up the earnings scale one goes particularly if one has to the services of a good tax of whom there are quite a few the reality is that when the government is to reverse the it into the tax the public finances will have out of i the government will look to lower earners first when it to increase taxes the carbon tax will not bring fairness to the system if such a tax is to work it should be revenue in the government will use the carbon tax in order to revenue members of the green party to have lost much of their thinking capacity however they fianna fáil has only committed itself to this measure as a way of the financial fianna fáil is no more in saving the world than it is in saving the economy in all this tax will have the effect of greater fuel poverty on the vulnerable and the country will be no to its targets i welcome the initiative on excise which i hope will save some jobs however a number of jobs have already been lost in the retail trade as deputy is aware border have been particularly hit in this regard however it is not just these that are affected people from all other are also across the border in order to the price of alcohol in ireland is one of the which them to do so i hope this measure will encourage people to a common sense approach and in their own and support the local who so them it is an fact that there has been a huge loss of excise and vat as a result of the of this island there is a market of some 6 million people across the island since the of the irish agreement trade between and has increased progress towards creating a all ireland economy is being made through the developed all ireland energy market and the of tourism ireland and which since has over businesses and created hundreds of jobs however much more must be done an all island economy is an in vat tax excise and currency create to economic development on both of the border and cost millions in tax revenue the of such will create employment wealth and opportunity across this island sinn féin the establishment of an all ireland economic members from the and the ireland and with taxes across the island a approach to promote our international food and an all ireland body to implement all standards that the of irish the stimulus of a couple of million euro in the budget is a the government has invested 54 billion into the banks and that we will be back here again next year in an even worse position this could have been if a proper stimulus package had been put in place in respect of enterprises which are struggling these are vulnerable but enterprises which are jobs and which would only a small and of financial support from the government to assist them in their current difficulties such financial support should have been provided in order that the people by these enterprises might have in employment i have many of the employers who could have those jobs with some support from the government it is most the government looked the other way there is no easy way out of this recession but there is a better way the government's way is to spending our way is to save and create jobs and protect the most vulnerable our way is better for the economy and better for people the only jobs the minister will create with this budget are in debt sinn pre budget proposed a stimulus package approximately 4 billion of gdp in 2010 that is a difference to the few millions of euro offered to job and today there was not even a decent in the of what it should have done the 54 billion to nama is approximately of gdp this quite a our stimulus is equivalent to the investment made in anglo irish bank which was some investment in a bank our proposals have the potential to save more than 100,000 jobs in 2010 and to create more than 100,000 more as well as better the economy to increase jobs in 2011 to trade union estimates the cost of new jobs will be 10 billion if we spend in 2010 we could see positive growth in the exchequer in 2011 if we do not we will see further there are people on the live register this number is to grow and there is no government strategy to deal with it the government claims that saving the banks will the economy them wrong will be to the many people who lose their jobs who face this christmas in debt in poverty and with the of the very small payments made to them by the state being cut emigration is already on the rise this year was the first in a long time that emigration sinn féin there is a better way forward we do not have to return to the 1980s our are and if invested in should see a return to the exchequer by way of saved social welfare payments and tax by the end of next year we have raised money for our proposals and some 2 billion from the national pension reserve fund which should be in this period of need our use of the is simple at this point in time the state cannot afford to keep money in reserve for future pensioners when the current generation of pensioners are being asked to live in poverty does this not make sense can the minister not see the sense in it we could this money now to help the state and when we have we would begin saving for the future again and implement a new system of decent universal pension provision that does not see spent on the private pension industry while state pensioners our proposals include a jobs fund available to million per year we want to reduce the cost of doing business by the cost of state services for one year we want to use the public sector and direct public employment to the economy the national development plan must be to focus on the more labour intensive and necessary infrastructure such as schools hospitals energy savings in homes and public transport provision this infrastructure will improve the state and provide jobs in construction and all other it will the economy which is what we need we also want to build the state child care and pre education sector through fully child care workers infrastructure and state for employees in this sector just like with the taxation system the need for a stimulus must be i do not have any in the government's ability to address it i the minister and others like him will have run this state into the before with vision is in office to turn things around sinn féin has set out its vision we may have a while to wait before a general election but i am there is much more damage fianna fáil and the green party can do before then my party will continue to set out the alternative i hope this budget the purpose of up the irish people the government may be to put itself before the irish people any time but they have long this was a opportunity the government could have turned its back on its policies of on the banks and only the banks while not dealing with enterprises workers or a proper job stimulus package young and old will as a result the budget has done nothing to help the economic crisis created by the of this government and its failed policies i look forward to further debate on this matter
this country has to address probably the biggest challenge to its economic it has ever had to face even though this is now in the context of our of the eu and the the budget will to and to others that we are in the challenge it is no time for half measures or long while others can suggest and or the government has the responsibility with the support of the for taking the measures that the public interest at this time even in these most difficult financial circumstances we need to keep forward and to provide a targeted stimulus to support and create employment there are many projects and under way or that will improve our competitiveness and quality of life in the years we also need to open up new areas of enterprise and jobs in the smart economy fairness is a key of the measures the main burden of adjustment has to be by those who are in a better position to bear it even if some contribution is from most sectors of society over a number of years now particularly since the income tax system has been made more progressive ireland can come through these times for the future having the of the full scale crisis both and global that we have had to face and solidarity which in among our people will help us through the difficult times and our confidence for the future the irish economy has been particularly affected by the present crisis and is going through an adjustment of a that has few modern international among developed countries we will have lost more than 10 of our national income in a two year period in a short time we have gone from a economy with budget as a to a economy that has up budget even though we put a of money into the national pension reserve fund and reduced the national debt to a low level we did not have the we competitiveness was and with the international loss of confidence from the banking crisis and our at the end of a construction boom a huge up at in 2008 and early 2009 between what we spend and what we borrow now for every 30 of income we are spending more than 50 that has to stop we have to stabilise it we have to it and we have no time to our tax have back to levels this means that next year if we did nothing we would have a deficit in the of 22 billion in our public finances to this we are borrowing more than million per week and that cannot continue the choice that us in this budget is that if we take the policy choices we can from recession its and if we tried to the choices to wait it out or to the pain it would be worse in the long run in any case the loss of confidence in that approach might be such that decisions would be taken out of our even if that did not happen the pain would be and it could be the before ireland any our strategy over the coming years is to bring back expenditure to 2006 levels as the world economy and demand for our increases there will be more people in jobs and our tax will rise this of cutting expenditure and increasing revenue has the of our deficit to a sustainable level by in order for this strategy to work we must take action to increase ireland's international competitiveness since the crisis 18 months ago we had to make adjustments to 8 billion out of short term necessity at half of them came from raising taxes and levies next year 2010 we are making adjustments of 4 billion in 2011 an on our last reductions of 3 billion will be required now will confidence in our capacity to out of the crisis our actions in the budget are already improving international of ireland and will help us continue to the investment on which we important it will help bring back confidence that we are getting on top of the problem increasing and helping to create jobs again our recovery will be also by the recent of the nama legislation this debate was the most and i have seen over a of a in national politics we are now among the first countries in the world to address assets and to make the banks face up to the scale of their problems this budget is one of the most steps on our road to recovery it is not an ordinary budget in ordinary times on the it is nothing less than our whole economic future confidence is the in today's global economy as we can see if we look about us whether we like it or not we have to show the international markets that we are of getting our economy back on and our fiscal house in order this budget is a moment for ireland however it does decisions which for reasons will be to many people around the country as the minister stated yesterday this budget has three key to stabilise the deficit in a fair way to protect those worst hit by the recession and to stimulate the sectors of the economy that will lead to additional and employment reducing our deficit expenditure and balance to the public finances will not come easy this budget is difficult for everyone but these steps must be taken and taken now it would certainly not be fair to future our children with more debt even the markets would us that i am aware of the difficulty and the pain cuts will people but government has had to take these decisions so that we can move forward again we do this not because we want to but because we must the government's approach in this budget was by a number of questions such as is it necessary is it fair and will it assist recovery the in each case is yes i have seen with my own what when a government to put off necessary action i in at a time when the public finances were under to that being experienced today the government of the day had planned to phase out the deficit in a four year period but the result was that by the time that government's term came to an end in early the budget deficit was as high as it had been four years recovery is just the pain over many more years we did that in the 1980s and the short term unemployed long term unemployed there was a lost generation to that would be the most unfair policy of all of the our for making the adjustment we cannot our currency which would a loss of real income instead the of the single currency a country to reduce its costs including incomes to restore competitiveness as against that the value and power of money will the only difference between the same income in money and income reduced by the same real amount in a strong currency is we have had many of incomes before but we have yet to to the more way it is now happening the consumer price the cost of living has by in the 12 months to there also has been a large fall in construction costs which is in lower prices under the capital programme and housing costs the reductions in this budget are part of this general adjustment social welfare public service pay public spending and capital are being brought into line with the new level of prices it is to that all our problems can be simply by increasing taxes on the wealthy without the need for from others or expenditure it the reality that taxes on higher earners have been increased very over the past year as my as minister for finance will show i am a strong of a progressive system of taxation it is estimated at present that the top 4 of earners pay some of income tax while half of income earners will pay no income tax although they may pay the income levy the top tax rate is to for example an extra 1 billion from high earners would mean the rate would have to rise to more than a level it last at in the 1980s as experience has shown such a move would be all of the available evidence that high tax rates will high workers from in ireland as well as high workers from here in the first place it is not a good policy while we are committed to the tax the commission on taxation has that there is no of through the or of tax reliefs and incentives we have raised the minimum for the effective rates of income tax for top earners from 20 to 30 on top of which come prsi and levies and this will yield an additional million in 2010 we have also decided on an annual levy of 200,000 on irish with substantial income and assets here to ensure they make a substantial contribution to the exchequer particularly at a time when everyone in the country is so hard past experience here and the international evidence are clear economies more from a fiscal crisis by cutting expenditure rather than increasing taxes three years ago ireland could full employment the most recent live register figures show there are now more than of our citizens without full time jobs we must do everything we can to stop this and reverse it the department of enterprise trade and employment will spend more than million in 2010 protecting jobs and providing training and supports and more than million in enterprise supports through enterprise ireland and other making a total package of billion we will directly and support approximately jobs through the employment scheme through the social welfare system we are helping more than people to part time jobs or work at a cost of well over million this package will enable individuals to receive training or supports in 2010 a key of this budget is to put ireland on the road to recovery within the financial we face we are providing for a stimulus

dividend of more than million net benefit to the economy in 2010 an employment dividend of around jobs next year a health dividend in that homes will reduce and from and which have a particularly negative effect on the a fuel poverty reduction dividend and an environmental dividend of savings of per annum which will assist ireland in meeting its gas reduction targets in addition a scheme of

provide a net benefit to the state in terms of tax revenue and reduced social welfare of between 30 million and 100 million it will provide a significant net environmental dividend in terms of reduced ireland to meet its international climate change to assist the retail sector in with the area we are reducing excise on alcohol and are the increase in vat imposed in 2008 the government has that it will its vat rate by from january next the tourism sector which is employment intensive has been under great pressure as a result of the global investment in will be increased three to 22 million and the overall tourism budget is being increased in 2010 to enable a drive to increase numbers and revenue by 3 we continue to be committed to the agriculture sector as a vital part of the economy we have made a large investment in infrastructure through the management scheme we are committed to an agriculture sector and are in with the european commission with a view to introducing a new five year environmental scheme we have 50 million for this scheme we are also providing million for and energy central to our smart economy vision is that ireland will become an innovation a country that is an home for as well as being an environment for the best at home from europe and further we must get more for less across all sectors of the economy public and private we are to invest in research and development and are a single funding for the strategy for science technology and innovation to the efficiency and focus of our investment and ensure that ireland's effort is targeted on those areas where we can achieve impact including through close with industry needs and a strong effort as a first step it will the funds currently by science ireland research funds by the the research funding of the and as funds to research of departments we will and the significant incentives we introduced in the past two years in research and development and the property environment we have committed to retaining the 12.5 tax rate and we are to new start in 2010 the three year and capital tax exemption we are retaining the exemption which is an important support for research and development intensive and companies the government forward to the report of the innovation on its recommendations in regard to further measures for creating a positive environment for innovation and property and the minister for finance has committed to these in the context of the finance bill we are a credit review system to ensure a flow of credit from the banks to support irish businesses and jobs in a small open economy like we must trade to that is how we will protect existing jobs and create new jobs the government will continue to support the enterprise sector as it to the competitive it currently in particular from currency against our main much of our effort in the past year has been on the economy with short term measures to help business and support those who lose their jobs we have already introduced a range of measures to support through the crisis including the enterprise fund the employment scheme and to apply pressure to energy costs we are also introducing a new prsi exemption for new employees which will reduce the cost of creating new jobs helping to get the economy again this budget is the start of a new phase where we begin to create sustainable jobs as the global economy to up last week we published a report how we could create new jobs in green enterprise in the coming years it proposals for green enterprise energy and a green the innovation is for job by making ireland the best in europe to start a high potential we already have one of the best of high in ireland our plan is to them to invest further in high value research and development areas and in the of that provide well paid jobs that will stay in ireland we will a new action plan on trade and investment early in 2010 our with new and markets in and we will continue to new opportunities in international services including financial services following the budget through the on economic i will drive forward our in all these sectors that all ministers departments and these opportunities so we can get people back to work as as possible the recent have further the necessity of building better where and other measures to the risk of flooding an increased of 50 million has been provided so that planned in a number of can be new and better systems put in place with a particular focus on some of the worst affected areas including and the and areas the second and third for are due to start in of next year to the minister of state deputy i will ask the minister of state to keep the deputy another of stimulus is to the housing market with not only the of mortgage interest relief for those who brought in and 2006 when the market was at its but the to buy a house in the next two years for still to of mortgage interest relief before it is abolished in years time this budget has been at a very difficult time for irish families i fully understand the needs of those who on social welfare and the government has done its to protect the most vulnerable people in our society the reductions in many social welfare payments are a but necessary part of this adjustment the reason we are reducing payment rates is to ensure that we have a sustainable welfare system which can continue to protect the most vulnerable a state that is would be of no support to those who rely on it for their incomes reductions in pay and welfare payments must be seen in the context of in prices the by in the 12 months to in 2010 we expect the to fall by year on year food is down by 6 energy by 11 and and by the reduction in social welfare payment rates is less than the fall in prices the value of the payments in people's pockets will if be higher than it was the support provided by the irish state to those on welfare is one of the best in europe in recent times there have been increases in the level of social welfare welfare rates have since in the past 12 years we have increased pension rates by almost unemployment benefit by almost and child benefit payments by more than it is out over the same 12 years the cost of living has increased by less in the same period government also and increased entitlements such that the level and extent of social support payments has been beyond recognition given that social welfare for about one third of all day to day spending reductions in this area had to be the scale of savings required from public expenditure as a whole means that savings in the welfare bill are what is most important now is that we can sustain a strong welfare system into the future if we do not cut back there might have to be more cuts in the future in that we increased welfare rates by around 3 in budget 2009 the net reduction is this social welfare back to around 2008 levels however the cost of living has come down by around 6 in the past year and is back at what it was at the of 2007 child benefit is back to 2006 levels the changes we have made have that over a three year period the spending power of people who welfare and or child benefit we have not the state pension older people do not have the same option of going back to work to their income they have all their and should not have to rely on their children to live in our tax are at levels but we have left welfare rates at 2008 levels so in cutting back on spending we are still those on the incomes to issues in the past year i have made it clear that i would wish to continue the positive with the social partners which a central in our economic and social progress over the past 20 years good progress was made in a last january which set out on how the present crisis should be it is but not that it has not been possible to continue the of partnership we have seen in recent years given the scale of the challenges and the of the economic and social which has the country i would not to that the social partnership is because we have failed to a agreement on this there to be a social partnership agreement in place in towards which out the medium to long term and for economic and social development there is for that agreement to continue to the process of social which will continue between the government and the social partners just as it the overall european way of doing business both at the level of the european union and within states the made last week to a pay agreement in the public service did not result in this was not for lack of effort or good on the part of the i set out in the house on 2 the which would have to be if agreement were to be these were not not because the about the scale and of the measures in reducing the cost of the public service pay bill were not clear given the need to that the measures taken in the budget would clear and change however i welcome the fact that the talks were by an of the need and the capacity to significant reductions in the public service pay bill in 2010 it is also significant that the were able to agreed to change and increasing productivity in the various sectors of the public service it is only through real and change based on how we do our business to the full the potential of new technology and ways of working and that those who work in the public service will be able to sustain their of living unless public service workers the same productivity growth as their private sector incomes will fall behind over time the to secure and income levels and to future for further reductions is the of change greater and new ways of doing our business should not us on the it should provide confidence and about the of employment and living standards in the public service for the future for that reason while that the current situation of is an one and that we do not have an agreed basis for forward i would public servants and their unions to on the potential to build on the progress made last week and to the direct and benefit of a positive approach to public service reform that the of those who work in the public service their incomes into the future and a more efficient service for our citizens on this basis is the best way to deal with about pay and conditions for the future i and welcome the fact that both opposition parties have put forward budget proposals in particular i am that they agreed with the government on the need for a 4 billion adjustment in 2010 however both parties on how to make up the 4 billion my however both parties in this respect based on what i am talking about on how to make up the 4 billion fine gael want salary cuts imposed on the public sector the labour party is to such a measure the labour party also wants to see an extra billion in taxes in a full year fine gael tell us that it is not possible to tax the way to recovery as they were on the banks the two opposition parties are on how to stabilise the public finances this is at the of the issue us we need action to put our public finances back on it is whether even in government the opposition parties would be able to agree a coherent and economic policy for the country we do not want a of the 1980s with the necessary action being the fine gael that it is not possible to tax the way to recovery is an given that the party large in prsi to fund reductions in prsi and the health levy to incomes over which is the same as a tax increase the labour party a new top rate of tax which would mean an effective rate of which is a to the failed policies of a more past over the next two years we will be spending over 100 billion in this country money will be invested in providing services from health to education to enterprise and jobs we still have million people at work the and services which will make our nation confidence in ireland is it is that same confidence that has shown in more in ireland through its open initiative a ago it is that same confidence shown by those who invest in our capacity as a country by our government they would not be these if they did not have confidence in our capacity to and did not believe we the will to do so at the global in after confidence in ireland to trade her way out of this recession these were not they were hard business people who have seen the and of economies all over the world we live in a competitive global environment but we also should not that our gives us a point in the world today with an irish of over million people irish we have a to into we have experienced people who have dealt at the highest level of business and built companies developed and markets the world over we must support these people now as they are the who will create the jobs we need to get our country again we have the ability to turn the corner the older people among us will have seen many and in their and know that for all our difficulties the of us are much better off today with adjustment and proper new opportunities and new ways of working we have the assets and the ability to back and to move forward again the economic and social progress we have made is something to be proud of our job is to restore with the stimulus to go forward on a new and
at the end of his response the taoiseach said that we have the ability to turn the corner the minister for finance we have already turned the corner to his yesterday the budget may or may not all the to our economic problems but it has the of an and to meet the need that is to start the of opportunity and competitiveness deputy that the government has too on a set of tax increases rather than on cutting the costs of running government could yet in such times can be that the government has the to the crisis in the public finances we now have a number of things we did not have last week we have a five year plan for economic recovery a strategy to up the banks and a of for public service reform we can only hope we will be able to look back on the supplementary budget of april 2009 as the first step in our recovery from economic that was the view of the of the irish on the budget on 8 april 2009 that set out the the and of the government through the minister for finance on that all of these have failed in the period if we were to believe all the taoiseach has said we should go home and hope for the best the budget is one of figures and is not for people it is a budget of necessity and not of choice it is a budget of not of this a budget for an election day but like st being made it is a case of not just yet a political choice was made by fianna fáil and the green party by the members in the hope that the from the budget would over and that in 12 to 15 months or some time within the next 100 weeks they might have an opportunity to be by the people just as the minister is about having turned the corner i am sure that when the government the of the in the next 100 weeks it will get its in no terms the to this budget had been well set out and we should not why we have at decision we have at it because the three former taoiseach deputy the taoiseach deputy brian and the minister for finance deputy brian lenihan all the set out in recent years about the in which this country was about the way we were down the of all our in one and that a day of would come by a day of necessity to make decisions the good about this budget is that the main opposition parties the fine gael party the labour party and to a extent sinn féin now did set out and agree on the of the for cuts in current spending of 4 billion the point made by the minister for finance in his pre budget was that the from the the oecd the and every was that it would be far better to deal with the deficit in the public finances by current spending cuts rather than taxation what did the minister do he imposed 6 billion of tax on people's pockets last april with a loss of million in revenue up to the end of the year he also got it wrong in respect of vat which he following pressure from and others his and those of the taoiseach when minister for finance were wrong the fact that he had all the evidence from the central bank the office of the financial and the department of finance that to down that road was with this budget with the questions of fairness jobs or competitiveness the of the government is not just in but is to do with anglo irish bank this is the i do not agree with the taoiseach that the extent of 4 billion 5 billion or 6 billion which he will come back looking for next year for of anglo irish bank is a matter from actions taken yesterday this is real money from the pockets of real and it is going down a the problem is that the circle is still while people are in we still have no evidence of any here either from reports of the of or the or it is worse when it that in some cases the developers were the bankers themselves the circle is very here yet the taoiseach to come back to the irish taxpayer as a as if it is not money out of their pockets and say sorry but we need another 4 billion 5 billion or 6 billion to out anglo irish bank that is the the other will be nama i last night to the minister for finance on and talking about the reason for up nama was to and now of resources of wealth are being to and bond investors in these banks it may well be that the government may be with having to implement if that is the case it is a failure on the part of the minister for finance in a small number of cases it as if the developers themselves are also bankers i am getting reports every week of the extent of up interest from anglo irish bank that in some cases is up to per week i if the taoiseach how a person who is a full time looking after a person with and who will have cut off their payment about this this is where the is and where this budget does not measure up from top to bottom those at the top have away free as in the case of mr and mr with pensions of 100,000 or more while the people who out the taoiseach's as has been out today take their 5 cut as the case may be the choices being made yesterday had to be made the good about this is the fine gael party in the of 4 billion set out a very different alternative strategy and a very different kind of budget where those vulnerable people the carers the the blind the widows the pensioners and the children were protected and those in the other area of welfare who are available and able to work and willing to work will be provided with challenges and training opportunities and jobs the taoiseach has made a clear political choice he may believe that the private sector which of may that they have been left by this budget simply because there is no increase in income tax the levies now to be and they will become because the taoiseach has not put in stimulus to create jobs in the way the fine gael party its alternative budget the difference between the two is that the fine gael alternative budget was much fairer towards those working in the public service particularly those at the lower end of the public service where every single one of the employees working for less than 30,000 would have no cut and with cuts above that the minister's budget means that those on the wages earning the minimum wage are now being to take the same as the brought in by ministers when they say they are taking a 15 cut in their own salaries to share the pain and to show leadership this morning on the minister for social and family affairs said it would a agreement of ministers taking pay cuts of 15 when in reality this is only a 5 cut this is budget is a it is about figures and not about people there is to be only a 1 reduction in the budgets of most departments and the budget has increased this is evidence of within all departments a a case of getting back to the of self in different departments over the past four months ministers were working in as to what contribution they were being required to make in order to meet this demand for a cut of 4 billion to see what they could off and what could not be off under any circumstances without any view as to how they would get the country back to work of how jobs could be created and how we can trade our way out of this the government has led us into they have at the same which fine gael has been for the past five years that they cannot tax their way out of it and that we must trade our way back a jobs stimulus package must be it is not just a case of the price of drink or such like the taoiseach could have used a and fairer approach in respect of the public service he could have decided last april to to look at the question of effective reform in order to bring about a more efficient public service and the of that service fine gael will see to it that down the line are given the responsibility and the opportunity to account for and be for what they do and if they wish to be to whatever departments might need them the taoiseach did not do this and he now has a public service i do not believe that a of will but there are people who are very on this issue deep down within the public service there is now a and an understanding that the of social partnership though it was in many is now and so far as fianna fáil the and the are the taking place in every department is seen as an of self of and a hope that the difficult days will the message being sent abroad will be by the international markets because it is about figures and not about people it is not about fairness or the taoiseach has used a to a saving of 4 billion and this will be by the international markets what the fine gael party proposed was so much in the context of the private sector because it provided more stimulus for job for young people for those who have jobs and for those employers who want to want to on to those employees and for the of new initiatives and opportunities to create new jobs this is the way we will get out of this situation not by talking about the irish who are from our country and will work in and and like 100 nurses from the who have recently of to cross hospital and the hospital in and other in the have paid to each of those nurses and they will be their services abroad there is no one to the quality and capacity of an irish and this is with due respect to other yet they are being sent abroad because the government over a health system which the taoiseach does not deliver efficiency either for the or in terms of value for money the system very well once one is it but all the problems are with getting into the system i with the view in the irish times today that this budget is above politics when we all talk about and then i say good to the people in the has not his in this regard the former taoiseach deputy said in effect we get in here and we stay in here and we do whatever we have to do to stay in here and i will whatever i have to for banks and i will do whatever i have to do to keep this going the community hospital could be in or it could be in or what the taoiseach has done in the of the recession this has ever experienced an economic crisis caused by his party is his up the steps to speak to the and do this is about politics and it is the reason i with the taoiseach that it is above politics or local interests in one way the taoiseach has not because this is about on to the who as we all know are always on the for a bigger to come by as it to and to when to with no stimulus provided the real problem is the lack of credit from banks to businesses mr from irish banks the on finance and the public service that when his bank the from the national management it will not them into credit for business since the guarantee was introduced the minister for finance deputy brian lenihan has told us we are in the banking sector and he will see to it that the banks deliver credit to business this is not happening day after day deputies including those are evidence that are to secure credit or facilities and in many cases are having simply because they came close to their this is not the way our country should be a credit is being introduced under which people will be told they may be to credit from a bank but there is no guarantee they will get it the for introducing the measure means many thousands of businesses which are on by their will go to the i know of cases of businesses which have never one and whose will not even be sent into the local bank there is no on the banks ten more shops will close down every day the decision to reverse the vat increase a measure the fine gael party for is welcome but is too little too the government had an opportunity to implement the reduction before christmas i do not know whether deputy heard a from on this morning about how she made a saving of 500 by to to do her shopping people are not across the border to buy drink but to a range of other from and to if the taoiseach does not get down to business and talk to his about the the in cross border shopping will continue six weeks ago my party stated that whatever the government does it should not with the of child benefit every other country in europe has an in built in the tax system to address the cost of raising families ireland does not have such a child benefit is of major to many mothers the government has made a in reducing it i am of a made by deputy whose are than those of most other people that there are many mean in this country and some mothers must ask their for every cent they spend in their budgets in this is a recognition of the value of paying child benefit directly to mothers the benefit is not what the government has done is wrong and will come back to it the reduction in child benefit for children who need it is a what message does the decision to reduce the carer's allowance by out to full time carers the message is that the work of people in full time is not by the state if carers did not have and respect for their and the people for whom they are would be in state at ten times the cost they provide full time care for family members in their homes because of their of family the government has sent out a message through the minister for social and family affairs that it does not value this care or the work carers do which the state hundreds of millions of euro every year the government has made a direct attack on the public service as a result of which public servants will a deep sense of the fine gael party proposed a real stimulus through the establishment of a new economic recovery authority under which progress would be made on water green energy a smart more than jobs would be created in the coming years in and for young people and of all of this is the type of stimulus we need and it is not in the budget the government may be to the private sector on the basis that income tax has not been increased but the fact that levies are here to stay and the economic stimulus is not what it should be i note the local government fund will be cut by 12.5 and road funding cut by 10 while the road by the road authority are very good we will find that with no money available in local authorities there will be and the county road will at enormous cost if the reduction in the local government fund is not no local authority will be able to balance its budget the government may have done this for political reasons given that the fine gael party many local authorities or because the minister for transport on of the government that county and will be abolished i do not know if that is government policy i to people speak of being made in technology and what the government is doing for schools am i to hear of from across the when a in a local school schools will be given even though a service may not be available as they used to say in country and the day big came to was a day to remember in this case we are all to say the day the in the school was training courses must be dealt with with respect many of the young people particularly young between the of 18 and years who are training courses have and problems providing training courses will not sort out their problems my which is given is that the government should an of courses running over 12 weeks and with limited to for this of young people with an identified problem young teachers should be to take the courses which should come under the management of this approach would be much more than these young people on training courses when there are problems with their and capacity i note 3 million has been for a on while i support this measure i suggest the government the bill introduced by deputy on of the fine gael party and use the opportunity at no extra cost to have a on the matter of pay to having an group and pressure on them to reduce pay as a of not being to a pay the government should have increased mortgage interest relief as fine gael proposed for people who houses from and are now in negative equity these people have a real problem and will come under even greater pressure when interest rates increase next year as the and economies grow if one job in a is lost will not be able to pay their mortgage the problem for those who want to buy new houses is not mortgage interest relief but to credit there is no sense of equity in the budget it is a which was out of and a failure to agree public service reform there is no stimulus in this for the jobs we need there is no sense of capacity to reform or have a more effective public service the taoiseach will not get it now because he the of the leadership of the public sector the private sector will not get the stimulus it should the taoiseach had a opportunity to bring about a situation five years people would think of this country as and one that will to the top of the again in terms of health education efficiency of public service of jobs and a place where people would wish to be this should be a country of real and energy which can back to the top but i do not believe the taoiseach will be able to do this he has a opportunity when the people their in due course they will give a on this government of fianna fáil and the green party it has been the worst government in the history of the state as far as i am
i put on that we are what is probably the most important budget in the history of the state but we are not a proper debate many members wish to contribute but the debate will in a short period from to my colleagues i am aware they are we were to people in his speech the taoiseach made to nama and the benefit of the long debate on that legislation but i do not see the benefit of a short debate on the budget this budget is probably the most ever and it will be on young families and the vulnerable the taoiseach referred to the government approach on this budget and that it was by three questions it the government everything in the form of three questions it must be the number i will address the three questions the first of which was whether this was necessary it is necessary because the taoiseach has made it so he the country into the before the last election when the taoiseach as the minister for finance he the people that the economy was fine he is trying to do the same now and the message is that the business has been done and there is no problem but he should be with the people he should them we are in a major financial crisis however we must be fair with people as well a person who for an came to my in the past two or three days the person for whom he per week they will now cost an additional per week which is the of almost per year will such people begin to make decisions such as that they cannot afford to get these will they end up in hospital with a cost to the health services there is a lack of up thinking i to the position of a the taoiseach made to the fact that he how can he understand that when someone has lost a the cost of living does not go down the government will take 8.30 per week from a or this shows a lack of understanding and that the government is out of touch we all agree there was a need for 4 billion of savings but the problem is the way in which it was done another question put by the taoiseach was whether the budget is fair it is not fair let us consider the issue in terms of the public sector of income public servants will be paid 5 less off there are people in the public sector earning 30,000 or less when the banks were out mortgages it was said these people were and many such young have 100 mortgages they can afford they have taken a significant in income we fairness and our party agreed there was a need for public sector reform we considered savings of billion however we proposed the first 30,000 of income for a public servant would be and that it would be if someone only of their income would be to a pay cut that is fair this is unfair shows a lack of understanding and it is will the taoiseach put on what happened at the pay talks why were there talks over several weeks but five days before this critical budget the taoiseach out from them the problem is the taoiseach is and to one must have the government has a public sector pay cut that everyone from the first euro not only that the government had the to state that ministers would take a 15 pay cut they will take a 5 cut but workers in the public sector will be to a 5 pay cut and further cuts the taoiseach did not to the cut from pension levy they took if we group these together it is clear the taoiseach should have referred to a pay cut of up to 10 or 12 he did not do so but the members of the government it this way for themselves we need and proper effective up thinking we do not need a government from crisis to crisis and in the key point is this budget is not fair the third question put by the taoiseach was whether the budget would assist recovery it will not the fiscal stimulus of reducing the excise on alcohol and a change to the vat rate i that there is nothing in that the taoiseach referred to the employers prsi exemption for taking on new employees it is welcome but what about those currently struggling to existing employees why did the taoiseach not consider our proposal to cut the lower rate of prsi by a half to for an and to cut the top rate by 2 that would have cut costs for employers while retaining the minimum wage for employees however there is no up thinking it the government has out a with no of bringing the economy out of recession i to nama the taoiseach that he took a view in terms of dealing with the banking crisis and that the government was dealing with the banks however the former of was before the on finance and the public services last week and stated nama would make no difference he also stated would not use the nama to funds from the to provide a stimulus to the economy the taoiseach the minister for finance and their colleagues came out and nama to the public as a fiscal stimulus that would get credit they stated they would make the banks face up to the scale of their problems but it is a case of the the there has been no change to top management or the of the banks we have throughout the country with deputy to meet business people the are very welcome but the people who will get the economy going are the small business people throughout the country the person who two three or four people many such people cannot take out of their businesses what is necessary to pay their employees they wish to keep people in employment to stay and they supports for existing employees which is not being provided the taoiseach referred to tourism one of the issues in tourism at present is the tax it did not yield any great income for the exchequer but the government did not see to it such countries as the of its way and it the problem with bringing the economy out of recession is that it must be considered in a way one cannot a line to the effect that the have 2010 will be a very difficult year for people we must give people hope but we must also give them a basis in terms of policy to deal with the cost for employers for existing employees as well as new employees the taoiseach referred to reducing the vat rate which is welcome but it should not have been increased once again the same have been repeated the vat rate was increased there is a in business that one never increases prices when business is going but the government did that in the budget the of that now that the government is the decision the change will not be until 1 january that gives and no to benefit from the change in the christmas period we that the lower rate of vat should be reduced that would not be as as reducing the top rate and labour intensive businesses once again would provide a stimulus how can the taoiseach use the fairness and understanding in the context of taking 8.30 from widows and people on pensions and from carers the scheme has been increased by approximately 40 to since i a deputy in 2007 the most vulnerable are affected once again the government has gone for the easy targets i that everyone has to pay his or her fair share an currently in the prsi for employees if one is currently and earning 75,000 or less one pays 4 prsi on the full income but if one more than 75,000 one pays no prsi on income above that amount why did the government not see to reduce that and make the higher earners pay their fair share to get the economy again the taoiseach made a in terms of the public sector in his speech in the context of further pay cuts the minister for social and family affairs referred on the this morning to further pay cuts for the public service the taoiseach should be of the old that one more with and out of talks five days in of the budget does not confidence we need to the and get everyone working together a coherent plan is required to move the economy forward but the budget is in that respect if we were to have a proper budget debate we would be able to consider the budget in greater the is always in the i note that the government has introduced cuts across a of areas deputy has referred to the local government fund and the budget in my constituency of a significant cut has been made to the housing budget it is down from billion to million the minister of state deputy is aware of that i question whether the of is under the biggest problem is lack of up thinking and a coherent plan which should be on jobs the taoiseach is well aware that the has stated that more than half of our general government deficit is caused by unemployment if we are to come out of the recession we must ensure that we existing jobs it is difficult to the taoiseach's statement that we have turned the corner when we will have 75,000 extra people on the live register next year unemployment in 2010 has been to be and 12 in 2011 it is important to be and with people the taoiseach should tell it as it is to ensure that is the problem with the budget is that the taoiseach has done young families are the of this country to go to the because and food are there yet the government is taking from child benefit that is the one payment that goes directly and to the and it is used for and extra costs while are also important mothers are the point for child the government has got it wrong it has not time for proper debate and in this house we should have had time in the house to go through the budget if the taoiseach wants to hear our he should the debate on the budget and allow every of the house to have an to what is probably the most critical budget does the budget the taoiseach's three is it fair no it is not is it necessary yes but because of the government's will it lead to recovery not because it gives no proper stimulus in terms of retaining jobs which is what the budget should have been about the government has an opportunity
i agree with one the minister for finance said yesterday namely that the ted kennedy was one of the best this country ever had i am that his is to be but ted should not have been to a budget that in the face of everything that he for and for ted kennedy spent his life trying to get a decent health service for the people he the biggest cut in any of area in the budget is to health services ted kennedy was a man who for the poor he said the poor may be out of political but they are not without needs he would never have measures that take money from the blind carers widows and people who have lost their jobs ted kennedy was a of public servants he always spoke with and with respect of teachers and local authority workers i what he would have of the that was by fianna fáil for the past 12 months to and the people who work in our schools and hospitals i was over the when a hospital told me how she had to meet an from a on a night out when she was as a the same now probably has something to about from this budget given the reduction in the price of alcohol all of that was done to public against public servants to the cuts in pay that were announced yesterday including the cuts in the pay of the paid workers in the public service the budget more to the thinking of than it does to the thinking of ted kennedy it is a the budget is built on bad and bad politics and by a broken government it will the country not it it will jobs not create them and it will push hundreds of thousands of families into poverty every family is today paying the price for 12 years of government by fianna fáil and the wealthy interests that the party but some families are paying much more than others the people who pay for everything must pay again the wealthy and have again been protected the in their have been the of this budget were never in there was support in this house and across political parties for an adjustment of 4 billion however choices had to be made what were the choices made by fianna fáil a minister will now take a pay cut than an in his or her department the public servant on at 4 of after tax income while the on ten times that 500,000 nothing at all the payments for widows the blind carers and people on are a family with two children under six years of age could lose widows of working age will take a cut of including the christmas payment a couple on pension a cut of carer's benefit is cut by per annum blind could lose up to the cost of drugs for families will go up per year however a 1 of the adjustment comes from the highest earners in the if we ever see it children are hit three times in this budget child benefit is cut the early is abolished and for children whose families are on social welfare the christmas payment is gone on price will not a child or him or her for school this budget was by the wing of a that does not have the first of what it is to live on a pension or to live in a house where the has no work there are cuts here that break new in political when one cuts payments for and schemes one cuts off some of the most young people in our society the price one will pay will be in of the cost of a place in st why has this been done it has been done because fianna fáil has brought the economy to its it was a competitive economy by creating jobs and with a budget it turned it into a property which has come down on all our in the past two years people have been put the dole queue fianna fáil has created one of the and in the developed world since the second world fianna fáil has created a deficit in the economy which on its own figures total of billion to put right it has our future through its in of the banking crisis a crisis that was of its own making there is a guarantee wider than any other the taxpayer to billion in nama a the of a generation has created a debt of for every man and child living in ireland today last night the minister for finance what the labour party told him all through last year that is that the banks would have to be that should have been done in the rather than doing it now by and probably at greater cost to the public and our economy fianna fáil has a new of emigration once again this christmas we will the of and loss at and as the of a generation these and their families are left behind to live with the some people are expected to leave ireland next year this is what the wing of the has brought on the of the and of people who pay for everything and for nothing that was the ireland we should have left behind that is the ireland that does that not have to be but always when one fianna fáil in charge it will buy until there is no money left in a generation fianna fáil has brought this country to it is never the wealthy or the who are to the can for fianna fáil now to itself as a party is almost this budget is based not on national or common purpose or social solidarity but on and fianna fáil has turned its back on the people and on its own in public service and in a strong state sector in the irish economy fianna fáil is no the party of fianna fáil is the this budget is a come to life public services attack public servants the poor and let the wealthy and the off free the that got us into this is running again it could and should have been very different the government had the opportunity to secure a national agreement to deal with the economic that it created the labour party proposed and would have a national agreement to deal with the fiscal crisis and the jobs crisis in a coherent and way we proposed a set of five on which an agreement for national recovery could be based namely a coherent jobs strategy for the family home a reduction in the public sector pay bill of a fair budget and a guarantee of just as we the government on because it was right for the country so too did we support a reduction in the deficit of 4 billion in this budget we did so because we put the national interest first and it is important that as a country we a commitment to dealing with this even if it was of fianna making as is clear now there would also have been support from the trade unions for a national agreement of this kind we know now that there was an opportunity for major public sector measures i have been for since the of this year and which i have called for directly in trade union in the terms and conditions of employment would have given the government the it needed to rebuild and reform our public services however the government all that whether it was a a or a all of this was away for short term political the system of national pay which fianna fáil has for so long is the taoiseach saying he will on the is thinking because he has from the those with whom he needs to an opportunity for reform has been lost a signal has been sent to the world that ireland is a house against itself a system of that well for 22 years has been by this time next year will have to the european and irish economies that will a of private and public sector pay claims that there is now no to address there are many who will that development some believe that national were beyond while others believe that leadership is by a to impose pain on others and that real leadership is by a to impose it on the those the pain know little of history and care less for the future the people who are sent away from the now will return only on their own terms because my will get one good in the short term but it will up in the medium term and will confidence in our capacity as a country to manage our way through this crisis there is a here and it is a low pay one people on low pay in the public sector have taken a hit young unemployed people have had their benefits cut in half the next target will be the national minimum wage these are to drive down wages at the lower end of the labour market rather than people and support them in new fianna fáil is creating a new of working poor a young will at a job that pays the minimum wage and a person on could find or by two people with who will cost their less fianna fáil had the opportunity of national and it it the labour party set out how this budget could have been and fair instead of cutting child benefit to save million fianna fáil could have made modest changes to capital taxes instead of cutting welfare payments to people of working age fianna fáil could have abolished all of the property schemes instead of cutting benefit for new mothers to save 11 million fianna fáil could have abolished any one of several reliefs instead fianna fáil to the my strategy the that if one one or two in society if one targets them and them if one them day after day then one can the problem them and others can their share of the for the past 12 months there has been an of and targeted at nurses teachers workers and for more than a year it has been as though it was these people servants of the people who caused the economic crisis it was not fianna fáil or the property developers that this budget did not touch it was certainly not the bankers there is a in the measures announced to cut the long term costs of public pensions when we consider that the pension fund has already been over to the banks the rich and of irish society have the and fianna fáil has to the they got nama and in return the of have been out in force these are the who do not the bank that them or the they trade and the tax who do not their rich in the run up to this budget we have had a queue of such people at the national bankers most of them us that cannot tax the rich sure they do not have a and it is all the of the the the road the alternative was to bring forward a budget that a fair balance between expenditure cuts and revenue measures it would be a budget based on the that those who have the most must contribute the most the government to do that it us that it is the budget strategy on international evidence to the effect that fiscal adjustments are expenditure based we can consider the international evidence to which fianna fáil is i to agree with who has said that the to which the government is are that do not apply to ireland's case a published by the european commission last year to agree it that the government's line is the but it also states more recent on country cases provide evidence that both expenditure and revenue based can be in other international evidence is fine if it is with a of reality and some common sense such common sense was set out by a key figure in budget crisis in the in an for the he if a package of both tax increases and expenditure cuts the effect can be fair fairness is not a or an extra it is the that a society together in a crisis this budget is unfair as it targets the poor public servants and children it the bankers the property and the fianna fáil off the this is a financial yet even during the of the second world it was possible to introduce child benefit to promote social solidarity child benefit is the only payment through which the state the cost of bringing up children in our society it is a payment that does not poverty because it is paid of a employment it is the this country has ever come to all the children of the nation the biggest in this budget is an of a coherent jobs strategy time and again i have made the point that the banking and jobs are we must deal with them all in a coherent fianna fáil has been so with the banks and the budget that it has the jobs crisis the measures introduced yesterday are nothing more than a they are a of to the of special interests there is no strategy here to promote the knowledge economy or even the smart economy only the smart economy it is necessary to make a major adjustment to deal with the fianna fáil deficit we will never get out of this crisis until we start to create more jobs we cannot cut our way out of a deficit and we must grow the revenue line as well we must lower the cost of this government's the cost of unemployment the cost benefit analysis here is easy as every person off the dole is one person being by social welfare and one more person paying into the exchequer in our pre budget statement labour identified adjustments billion which would allow for the 4 billion adjustment in the budget deficit while at the same time creating a jobs fund of at billion jobs fund would be a key in a strategy to deal with the jobs crisis objective is to the irish economy it off its on property and return to led growth this country can be a leader in the global knowledge economy if we take the necessary steps now to support that change there are four actions we must take to make this change a reality first we must create a of enterprise supports that are both and deep as the world economy to new opportunities will open up for irish business there is a new and deep of in ireland that we have to support whether it is a new start up an programme or a research off we must the of supports available to irish companies second we have to do the same for people it is simply and to have more than people on the live register with more to come next year we must find the means and resources to give these people opportunities to and work experience the of money involved are not great and labour has shown how it can be done third we need a strategy for investment in infrastructure and companies we need a new national development plan to more limited resources to the government says it has done a review but we need more than that we need a new plan we need to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the knowledge economy labour has proposed the establishment of a state investment bank to assist in the of public investment and we have to ensure there is growth capital for with that need financial support to grow we need to deliver jobs not everyone can or will be in a or a high start up we must ensure that job opportunities are up across a range of and across the i welcome the initiatives on tourism and i will keep an open on what is being proposed for the food sector we need that will build on the back of our in sectors such as technology food and the the and of the irish people is not just a it is an economic in the as many people as financial services above all we must rebuild confidence in this economy the minister has spoken much about confidence and well he might because he it along with the other three of economic collapse and the taoiseach deputy brian the collapse in confidence in the irish economy is both and international following the disastrous of the banking crisis irish government debt now costs basis more than the equivalent debt in and at home the savings has the estimates that the savings which in 2007 was will 11 in 2009 and 2010 that is the equivalent of taking some billion out of the economy if we are to restore confidence we must do more than just attack the poor we must families that their home will be there must be greater for real action to clear out the banks and a to ensure a flow of credit to business the real confidence building measure that the country needs is the one the taoiseach will not us a change of government this government is broken beyond it is led by a taoiseach who has been by his minister for finance in the taoiseach's contribution he spoke of a 3 billion adjustment next year but the minister for finance spoke of a 2 billion adjustment in his budget speech the taoiseach then has the to suggest there are in approach between fine gael and labour when the present government does not to even be on in what the target is for 2011 this government will on and will more and more damage as it does so the irish economy and the irish people need a start and a new they need a government that will put jobs and people at the heart of economic policy and which will make the hard decisions on spending but make the right decisions on jobs fianna fáil cannot do that as it does not have the moral authority the imagination or the wit this budget is a and so is this government nothing up this budget more than the proposal to take money from the blind there are government deputies who will return home this after for the social welfare bill and tell their that they did not have any choice in doing so because they were under the six deputies are not under a and they have an choice to make deputy has a choice to make does he support taking money from widows deputy has to decide whether he supports taking money from the blind deputy has to decide whether he supports taking money from carers deputy has to decide whether he supports taking money from people with deputies and have to decide whether they support taking 1 billion from the health service and if they do will the people of ever see the and other services that are being lost in their local hospital
the labour alternative budget was based on fairness and solidarity it was and it was in meeting all those what was being proposed could have achieved enormous public that would be different from what we heard yesterday which was about politics the government was well by those who for the past few weeks the there is no alternative and we got a a limited analysis and a of that was to be us very little was left to there is an alternative to which might be to for some members it is there are radical however the was of a radical alternative for example former taoiseach deputy spoke about his force on citizenship this was an opportunity for citizenship one could in the of and from a recession citizenship in terms of a below which people should not be to fall but that did not happen the government could have issues of instead of any of and a political economy that would include which were beyond fiscal adjustment we got a that steps were the only steps and these had to be taken and we got a that or other the had created the problem in more recent weeks one could not speak at all about how we came to be here it was as if the position we are in was not the position to which we had been by fianna fáil ministers those in charge of who failed us and public and those who ireland's abroad and for which ordinary now have to pay more taxes to service interest rates that are above the these are and to to them was quite the taoiseach stated that he has been in the house since but i have been here since since then i have spoken about the of the economy this to the economy as a system where the people do not matter the blind do not matter the do not matter or the without jobs do not matter it is all the young people's and they are before they but it is not a failure of the economy that limited thinking is not moral or of any value in getting out us of where we are on 2009 a long time after i the house i asked the minister for finance in question no what proposals he had for income from wealth he i have been that no general research has been out over the past ten years by either the department of finance or the revenue the extent and of wealth as to income that was always the case opposition to a wealth tax in the old days was not to the yield but to what it would yesterday it was in regard to the tax breaks for example that or other we have just come to our present position like it was an attack of the in annual tax reliefs cost us billion which to 22 of total taxation that is the year my deputy labour party on finance raised the issue of people having a tax rate of less than 5 the minister announced yesterday that he has made significant progress because the effective tax rate of those who are at the top of the will move to 30 but there has been no from those who and wealth during the years in addition of those who of such tax breaks in recent years were on incomes of more than 200,000 and were on more than 100,000 tax breaks were then provided for car health and so on those who had money were it in to of these different tax breaks in one year billion was invested in property abroad are any of these people paying for this so called adjustment which is in fact a management of the economy are any of them such an adjustment in the of citizenship to use the former taoiseach's in order that for example those who were and into the might pay a fair share in getting us into a new i am and of people being as on and in a public service system that does not offer economic but rather goes along with the of the what kind of analysis is made by those who are involved in this when it all down the that one should say to the most vulnerable and broken the widows and children and so on that they must pay for all this because it has to be is bad thinking i it is when someone from the right wing school the that has failed us comes on and the used in the is when someone with the same an equal comes on the of a trade union is used as the it is as if we have a high of failure the same people who could not the property or speak about the government's on one of revenue are the people who now say the of the poor must be among those who are to the front to pay for our adjustment what a it is that this recession is not being used to build citizenship and to an politics that would put all the for job and into the green economy and the economy that instead of cutting carer's allowance would carers at work that would do a deal with the public service unions and the private sector to share work create new employment and the working day and that would have a decent society instead of a society that is deep into a drink problem one could do all those things for citizenship but the high of the no more than the minister for finance do not have the moral courage the ability or the commitment to speak about a alternative the labour alternative which was fair effective and in solidarity and it could have offered hope
i have been in the house for quite some time and i have to various on various in good times and in bad one was from speech by the minister for finance and this speech by the taoiseach it is a simple anglo and it is the sorry not once has fianna fáil said to itself to the nation or to the members of this house sorry we up they do not do in fianna fáil but if they did it would be a start yes we have up yes this country has up and some people are more for it than others the start of a recovery that would the of citizenship to which my and deputy referred and which was once a for the former taoiseach would be we will get out of this crisis we will not get out of it the way the labour party wants to get out of it we will not get out of it as as fianna fáil we will get out of it we will for the rest of their people who will be the because of the damage done to them i am thinking in particular of the type of person referred to by deputy such as a person who because of a broken home is looking for a second at education in a programme that will now be all of the research shows that such a person will cost the government me and the taxpayer far more money when he or she up in than the amount of saving that cutting the programme will achieve this is not even to in the cost of the damage to such people their partners and to their children international show that equal societies are fairer societies international also show that equal societies are societies and are more competitive consider the competitive economies in and yes they are high tax economies and that is their choice however they are also much fairer societies and are more competitive than i want to say to fianna fáil that the in being in this debate is without when will we be able to go through the of estimates and ask ministers what it means what is the impact of this why has the minister for education and science deputy decided to leave the primary and sectors but to impose a 4 cut on the third level sector we hear about the smart economy the knowledge economy in third level education and trying to get a of those coming out of schools into third level in most cases this is to a generation whose parents never went to third level and who are of it because they do not know it never experienced it and are of taking on debt and borrowing to put their children into that world of experience which they never had however we are a 4 cut on third level education it quite but i have had only a to at one i my colleagues could only do the same for the for which they have responsibility i one of the speech made by the minister yesterday at last the government will deal with the tax exiles the tax exiles does them an they do not they are not exiles they are tax i find it hard to what the minister deputy brian lenihan stated yesterday with what i in the some weeks ago about the of this republic a by a tax what type of message on citizenship did that out we all could provide of our choice if we had taxes that is they are not tax exiles they are tax when we see the legislation and i note the in the chamber of a of the department of finance i will the department to consider the following because it will be very to see how the of that provision is it will be hard to impose and i suggest the simple additional to the legislation that any tax who wish to their which are eu and are of great benefit would have to do what a a has to do namely provide a tax it is very simple and is used all the time by the department of finance for trying to get jobs of one type or another i would like to many other but time me from doing so the house will have to find a way of in the impact of the damage that this budget will do to so many sectors of our economy how that is to be done i do not know today's business was in such a way that after the of the various parties have spoken the debate will end and will not be that is an to every deputy to the house and who has something to say from their experience and constituency we will have to find time to bring ministers before to how will impact on the of services there are put forward by this side of the house to the fianna fáil and green party members present i state that i know they will not an election but they could start by saying they are sorry that they up that they will try to it as best they can and that they will take when they like it from this side of the house they receive from this side of the house that never in its life did fianna fáil offer when it was on this side of the house the taoiseach spoke about how he came to the house in i remember and i remember the man who where the leader of the fine gael party now one deputy all we got was and from a power party whose only objective was to get to the other side of the house and use the position of power we now know that was mr as it is in the public the house has been with the of this side of the house to the fianna fáil party and the government i am sorry they have not had the courage or to them and implement some of them
i welcome the opportunity of to this debate on the budget as leader of the green party and as minister for the environment heritage and local government as leader of the green party i want to take this opportunity to set out my position on budget 2010 there is no that this budget is very tough but the green party hard with our partners in government to ensure it was fair i believe that taken in the people will find that it is fair under the circumstances comes into public life to cut the pay of public sector workers comes into public life to reduce welfare payments however given the scale of the public pay and welfare spending there was no other option this is about our future and my colleagues in the green party are in politics to tell people the truth we believe that is far more important than short term the truth is that there is no easy option to our current crisis in this budget we have in protecting pensioners and education services including cuts from last year as well as providing a stimulus for jobs in the green economy i have stated on many in the house that we must take on the of the 1980s for which the people paid so it is on us to from what at that time we must take measures to ensure this recession does not continue for the next or more i am proud that the tax increases introduced in recent budgets have been progressive in effect a single person earning now pays 500 more in tax and levies than in 2008 however the additional taxes and levies imposed on those earning amount to almost or times the contribution of a person on i am by that the budget increases the minimum effective rate of tax paid by the rich to 30 in addition to prsi the health levy and the income levy this will be the minimum paid by high earners of any reliefs we have dealt with some of the tax and we must continue our work in this regard the budget also the issue of tax exiles or as deputy referred to them tax i agree with that we will introduce measures which will impose on all irish and individuals whose income 1 million and whose irish capital is greater than 5 million a to pay of where they are tax an irish levy of 200,000 per annum the of the carbon levy is a very important step forward for this country in the context of tackling climate change in the week before government from across the in ireland is out a clear message that it can and will its part in the against climate change a price on carbon will encourage people to make the be it to lower vehicles or improving the energy efficiency of their homes in order to additional costs by a price on carbon we will also be raising revenue the will be into making our economy and society more energy efficient by a price on carbon we will be a more competitive economy reducing our on and retaining more money in that economy next year the government will invest million in for more than 100,000 homes across the country some million of this will be for low income families fuel for those on social welfare will be increased next by 11 in order to ensure that the levy does not impact them this money will also enable the government to cut other taxes and promote the economy without this extra money we would not be able to provide a prsi exemption for employers who take people off of the dole or to reduce the vat rate that is in line with recommendations from such as the and the sustainable development this budget is also about hope over jobs have already been created in the green economy since the green party government the budget shows that the stimulus is in the green economy we will provide the jobs of the future as we climate change in that context there will be jobs per annum for two years in water jobs will be and created in the water services investment programme and jobs will be and created in home i have that this is a tough budget but i that under the circumstances it is fair my colleagues in the green party and my colleagues in the department of the environment heritage and local government are determined that we will face the challenges and we will not try to under state them we will continue to work for a better and more more sustainable ireland the actions in this budget will bear it will bring a signal of hope to our young people that they have a future in ireland it will our eu and international investors a strong signal that we are open for business we have important work to do and we will get on with it
i have a sense that the nation is and but not if there was one line in speech that people hope and their it was that the worst is over if i am the minister we need a sense of where we are going and of hope the debate can change there was a strong sense of the country being until yesterday and i would to see us into thinking that economic has and that it is the end in itself that is not the the government must provide financial but it is not the end or the purpose we must do more than that there must be a sense of vision of what the and how we work from that that is important in the debate that next week and into the new year on where the country is going we are at a moment of change in the history of the nation the world and the of the market system that has been for the past 30 years it has in the past year we must a different sense of where the nation is going in respect of this new and world i will set out my on how the budget into where we are going what we might call the new republic that we must create must have a number of it has to be enterprising we must take on some of the thinking that has been around for the past 30 years i am old enough to remember the report which stated that we should start to rely on our resources not on direct investment the report in the and the enterprise strategy group five or six years ago repeated that we are at a moment when we must start to do that we continue to be a good for international companies but we have and and have enough to start to be enterprising in our own right and to trade on the back of those i understand the sinn féin members about emigration i fully agree with them but we should have the confidence now when it is difficult to to stay and businesses here rather than look for that has to be our and our we will keep our people at home and create the work opportunities here rather than emigration as an alternative that is not the vision or plan of this government we need to be enterprising last week at a meeting i heard enterprise ireland say that in the past year it has had high potential start up companies on its if half a of those go from high potential to reality which i believe they will those companies will create the jobs it is happening and are being enterprising and and we have set the conditions for that by up research and research and development tax systems to help those companies we must be enterprising this government has put the in place to make that happen i agree with my colleagues in the labour party that we have to be equal and with when he says a more equal society is more competitive and one a analysis of the past two years would show how this government has the tax system to tax those at the high end of the scale and to cut out the reliefs that were part of the property problem it has happened we will push it to the that does not damage our other of creating an enterprising society on a more note one of the questions raised in this budget was whether to cut services that was a to which i say no it is better for us to manage our affairs here taking some of the hard decisions on pay and social welfare to protect the services that are to an equal society to the whose or is going to a special needs school this morning it was important to be able to say that those schools stay open and that in fact we have provided an additional because that is important for our equal society i am not sure that the would make a call we are willing to make those hard to ensure that those schools stay open and that where teachers are needed they are provided yes to the carers when it comes to health services which form a huge part of our budget we have made the hard call it is difficult i have from and others around the country saying that we have cut their incomes in a way that is not fair we did that on the basis that we keep our health services open so that everyone here has an equal right to the health services they are due i can understand the and of the who have to take a cut in a difficult time an equal society means that an older person who might be at home at night because someone is in an social way can the at any and make sure they that is a essential service that we must keep as we manage our budget this government made a call to keep the services we built up when we were wealthy that is behind the decisions in the programme for government and in this budget we need to be enterprising equal and green if we are creating a new and different republic it must be in with what is happening in this world the issue is that we are living beyond the means of the to sustain life we must and to bring our country into with and live within its means that will help us to be enterprising there is a stimulus in our green economy it is happening it is real we are going into of thousands of homes to help people lead and more efficient there is real development in a new economy here my department is committed to this by a new infrastructure into schools using new based on some of the technology coming out of our new enterprising companies they will provide a increase in energy efficiency and the power of it is being built and here and we are in it in this budget they are the three things we need to do and we tried to do in this budget support enterprise create a more equal society and turn green it is a very we are at the point of change the first 30 or 40 years of this country were by the nation i have seen nation my parents and my generation who built a very society on that we need a new nation now we need leadership in the political system and across our country that comes from a sense of purpose that is what we need to start we need to move on from this on the budget as one of or they are difficult but we must come out for our people with a sense of where we want to go and what we want to do every of society has a those dealing with the difficult caused by climate change need a sense that they have a they are the front line of a green economy as they go into and high value and low food which we do have they can benefit from that green vision our party has always said that one does not measure by economic standards the who is a job and should be at the of the front line services that we all talk about we need to support and protect such parents it was difficult but i say to the that we had to do that to make sure that the teachers were available for her children that was the decision we had to make we also have to work with our unions i do not believe partnership is we will work better as a nation for the that we must achieve when we work together we need to work with our unions and our business people to make that happen this budget does not address one constituency over another it gives us an economic stimulus to work towards a new society
deputy stated that this government does not have the moral authority imagination or wit to the challenges that face ireland i with him because i believe that moral authority comes from leadership and rather than from the it comes from policies that have been about for years rather than talking about what should be done policies that climate change our banking system and not only tackling the flooding that has affected so much of the country in the past few weeks but also tackling its the and the proper policies that fine gael does not have the to implement in local authorities around this this government has the moral authority and the well rather than the of the opposition it has the imagination to create the new jobs in energy agriculture transport and construction that this green budget will it has the imagination because it has new in the form of environmental and in using money it has the imagination to fund education that came from the programme for government we agreed two months ago imagination will help us get through this but not if we put off making and to work that are past their by the government has the wit to get credit again so businesses can create new jobs it has the wit to directly in our major who will drive the knowledge economy it has the wit to provide that give homes and save money the government has the moral authority the imagination and the wit to help us get through this i take issue with deputy of what we are doing not only within the budget but in the programme for government recently i asked the minister for finance a question on our national debt at a time when many are saying we should not have a short but should move out over many years it is for a moment on what the cost of our national debt will be unless we take action this year we will spend billion the national debt and this will rise to almost 6 billion next year if we do not make the kind of adjustments that are proposed in the budget before us this will rise to billion by in other it will more than over a four year period i take issue with mr when he says we should this out for several years the only that will stop us going down the of economy for ten years or from the 1980s is taking tough steps now that will get us through to the far side of our economy that will make those new jobs happen this will pain but it will be a pain that will get us through to the far side and create new jobs that will up our economy in the future those on the challenges before us have to face up to this very real difficulty that before us today throughout so many sectors of the budget we see incentives that have a green which are helping us to get through this i the point made by the minister deputy that we are protecting education against what could have been cuts it is that we invest in young people and give them the kind of and in their years that gives them and opportunities later on the of our teachers are doing work in providing a decent future for our young people it is right that we protect education and continue to our school programme to provide new schools and for of existing schools so that our children one of our most vulnerable resources are protected and this is a part of getting us through the challenge that is with us at present we have to face up to the banking crisis the jobs crisis and the fiscal crisis as deputy out the policies within this budget will get us through to the far side although it will not be easy there is no new that will come in a week a month or a couple of months however we need to get our finances in order and stop borrowing enormous of money so that money can be better spent on our our children and businesses to more people again through the changes we are making to prsi the real jobs that will come through this next period will come from the private sector and from the led economy they will come from small and medium businesses that are even in difficult times to more people and find their way through the kind of work our and county enterprise is in and the kind of training policies we have put in place through this budget are part of the that will get us through this as an example of the kind of initiatives that will help us i recently that over the christmas work will be done in house to gas with this is a good of the kind of changes needed in the economy instead of gas we will use irish to contribute to the and that comes through this chamber it is a good example of creating jobs in ireland reducing carbon and to the kind of initiatives that are required over the next ten days in as world to climate change it is in reality in employment not in the kind of and that came from the fine gael and labour party last night when we carbon tax this is it is real it is creating jobs and it will get us through the tough times the budget is part of a coherent approach to tackling the huge challenges ireland at present it is a time of enormous debate with the crisis we face with recent reports on child if we can make the in society that can make us proud again in the social and the economic we can get through this this is the first step in creating a new ireland that will create employment see us through and make us proud again
last night the between government deputies and those who them wider than ever before the people looked on with as the members of fianna fáil and the green party a budget that the poor the low paid and the medium income earners it was a budget together by economic the minister deputy speech must as one of the of self we have ever had to to either that or he is certainly he is trying to the irish people he told us we are on the road to economic recovery who does he think he is like a first world general the minister told us the worst is over and that this is the last big push i was him to say it will all be over by christmas if it is the last big push we know who over the top the low paid workers and their families the social welfare recipients the carers and the young unemployed the fianna fáil last week a over the talks with the public service unions however there will be no when they through the to support cuts to the welfare payments of the most vulnerable of our society the fianna fáil must be the of that ever on those their only hope now is to try to together and they are not into an early general election when many of them may the will be through the then at the they will go home and to their that they had no choice that there was no other way that the public was and that we all have to bear the pain shame on them all shame on their in the green party shame on them for what they are doing to those who on social welfare they have cut a through social welfare benefit schemes and schemes allowance assist pre retirement supplementary welfare allowance all cut widows and pensions cut benefit cut one family payment cut pension and pension cut as well as the allowance and blind pension quite and this budget cuts both carer's benefit and carer's allowance they are taking and per week out of the pockets of people who are for and or in their homes people on allowance will lose 8.30 per week these are the the person on carer's allowance will be out of by per month or per annum the carers has quite out that carers are the only social welfare recipients who have to work for their payment by providing full time care in the home to and people it has been estimated that family carers provide more than million of care each week more than billion to the irish economy each year the family carers providing full time care more than the nurses by the hse contribute billion to the economy this cut is the that carers get the minister deputy lenihan claims the objective of the budget has been to for fairness fairness how are where is the fairness in the cuts to social welfare support for young unemployed people this budget cuts allowance for 20 and year old new from to 100 per week and to 150 per week for those between 22 and this is a further attack on young people who are the of the dole queue it the april of allowance for 18 and year old people who are these young people these are the children who did their between and 2007 at the of the and their between 2006 and 2009 as it was coming to an end they were told they were being in a knowledge economy and that if they for the best they would rich in a state with full employment now however to the disastrous policies and of fianna fáil led they are being on the unemployment in the past two years the numbers of young people unemployed under the age of 25 has by we have the second highest level of unemployment among 18 year old in europe at more than the state unemployment rate of 12.5 it is 25 years since was on the in but here in the fianna fáil green budget of 2010 we find and well the minister us the purpose of his cuts to young people's dole is to encourage them to stay close to the labour market i am sorry the green deputies have left the house because the minister for the environment heritage and local government the leader of the party a few ago told us that it would bring a signal of hope to our young people that they will have a future in ireland what future the minister for finance claims that the experience of the 1980s was that the welfare system was out of step with labour costs in the rest of the economy and people in that type of thinking was wrong then and it is wrong now it as saying that we should not pay the any more than the or they will not want to work the same is in the decision to the dole to 150 per week for where job or measures have been what kind of job what kind of measures there can be many reasons a person would not take up a particular offer there was no real recognition in this budget of the of unemployment there are people on the live register in this state an increase of more than in one year there has been an increase of in those for allowance since 2008 but where is the jobs strategy in this budget there is none there is a of training measures to a million it is an let us be real about this the government does not unemployment because it the in our society the have always a high rate of unemployment because it them to workers to the message is simple lower wages and conditions or get out there are more out there in line what of people who are in work this budget low and modest income families by a 5 across the cut in the wages of workers in the public service earning under 30,000 per year and on earnings between 30,000 and these public service workers who make up the single of public service employees are those who will be hit the by this budget this budget those families on modest incomes they are now the of pay cuts and the cut to child benefit a family with three children nearly 50 per month many such families have just one pay coming into the and have to meet mortgage payments out of that single income the cut to child benefit is an attack on children and an attack on families net child care costs in this state are of the average wage to in eu and oecd states child care costs account for 30 of family income in this state as against 12.5 in eu and oecd countries over the past when people called for a real state child care strategy with proper infrastructure and that were and to all who needed them we were told that we had the most generous child benefit system and that this was how child care would be once again it is those families bringing in wages and struggling to make meet who will be hit their child benefit will be cut and if they are above the income they will receive no family income to it is these same families and others like them who will be hit by the increase in the for the drugs payment scheme they now have to pay more every month for to its cuts to pay and social welfare the government claims that the cost of living has gone down but this is not the case for the of people for struggling families this year prices went up for a range of essential such as gas child care primary education and hospital services in her health estimates statement the minister for health and children claims that planned reductions in the drugs bill in 2010 will save million in addition to million saved this year such savings could and should have been made long ago and more savings can be made through reduction in price and wider use of drugs and the establishment of a state as sinn féin has long why then does the minister to target medical with her charge of up to 10 per month this charge the general medical services and the long term scheme once it will remain in place to be increased year on year at the of those who rely on our public health system the budget has dealt a further to the already struggling public health system the two public private system is in terms of and the health it and its in using public money to the private health care industry health care will not be affected by this budget it will still be but the public system will continue to the budget million out of current expenditure in the hse on the so called economies and capital spending by a further million the funding for health is too little too it is of the by this government and the hse that they have until the total collapse of property prices to try to the of former we have yet to see how much this will and when with the still in place with nurses still in short and now going to be paid less with and still our hospital with our primary care system still not developed and with hospital services to be we are in for another and many more of health care to this government one of the under so called economies for the hse is transport in my home county people rely more than ever on hse provided transport since the of services in general hospital last that need will become even greater in the with the of services at the county hospital in yet we are told that transport is going to be cut it is an in a which in recent weeks has seen its already hospital infrastructure further with of in our of hospital in and our hospital in the of of and the of and i have a question for the minister for finance and the minister for health and children will every deputy who for social welfare cuts get a 40 hospital in his or her constituency good to the people of but let us remember the hospitals across the state that have been or have lost or will lose key services due to the of the self same government in through the health policies of this government to the cost of their shame on every one of them the full extent of the health in this budget will become clear in time and public will pay for them i spoke of the government's repeated that we are a knowledge economy the minister deputy brian lenihan not to in his speech the cuts of million to education in 2010 it is an that has been cut from the budget for building and primary schools children will continue to be in and millions will continue to be in for so called this year the government announced a 150 million programme for it equipment in schools but only those schools which have been developed or this deal with the it companies all other schools out of the the money should have been spent on providing school for those who need them most in place essential infrastructure and helping to provide employment in the construction sector the government's to be protecting the vulnerable as well as people to themselves out of is as a when we see the cuts to support to for and the of from recipients of back to education allowance the 11 cut in of measures to help people third level and the cut for the same purpose from the fund of course teachers pay will be cut so much for the knowledge economy that this government to speak about this budget has been by throughout the past year to and public sector and private sector workers it has been by fine gael and labour and by large of the the by the so called main opposition parties of a figure of billion for the of public service pay in 2010 was a major for the government public service workers were and the was set for the collapse of the with the public service unions last week the of the fianna fáil was the for the collapse and the was clear for the government to impose the pay cuts in yesterday budget statement yes the highest earners have been hit and so but the across the 5 cut for low and modest income earners in the public service is wrong those earning top rates can give a great deal more make no any ordinary workers in the private sector who were enough to think that they will benefit from this cut to the incomes of ordinary workers in the public sector are in for a if the government away with this attack on low and modest income earners in the public sector then the private sector will be next for an even worse hit the next target will be the minimum wage and wages and conditions across the public and private sectors while ordinary workers and families have been hit hard the wealthy have been protected once again this is a fianna fáil in terms of economic need there was no tax reform in this budget there should have been a new third and top rate of tax at for income in excess of 100,000 which would have raised million all tax relief would have raised billion but the government once again turned its back on that opportunity the government has tried to us that the wealthy are now over in 2007 the top 5 of households in the state billion in assets that did not all into with the property price collapse in 2008 people or of all earners took in approximately billion between them most of all more than 25 of the top earners paid tax at a rate of less than 25 the price of not introducing a wealth tax for the few is for many there were some tax changes the carbon tax has been brought in as a revenue raising measure that once again will hit those able to afford it which is why sinn féin against it last night in this chamber we have been with water charges the minister announced a system for every in the state but he did not say how much this will cost before a cent is raised in water charges the cost of introducing the will no be huge and instead of this money on and for a necessity the government should spend it on improving our water infrastructure and reducing the of water in existing systems the vat rate was reduced but by not nearly enough and should never have been increased in the last budget the alcohol excise measures should help restore some balance in trade along the hit border but this should be seen as a only much more needs to be done to help the economy of the border and i mean on both of the border the only real will be tax and currency on this island as a whole the real to this budget the of not just a single in the is the 54 billion of the people's money into nama to out banks and developers and to put future in debt the government's of to take 4 billion out of the economy to close the deficit and show fiscal is a total when set against the 54 billion on nama those young people not to by this government will have to bear the burden of nama for years to come nama and this budget and further budgets of us are the of the circle of bankers and developers who have the irish economy and it is the most vulnerable who are now once again being to pay the minister for finance deputy brian lenihan and the taoiseach have tried to put a positive on this budget the minister the community of the people who to the of those hit most by the recent flooding he has some given the lack of in the government response to the flooding the funding made available to deal with the and above all the fact that government left people across the country vulnerable to this flooding in the first place also by the minister was the of the kennedy family in county this was but not in the way the minister his budget and his government's policies are a for the emigration of unemployed irish last year he them 10 per to leave the country when he introduced that charge for all those our by this year he is making sure that ireland is a house for young people and that the is open for them to get out there was and is an alternative to this disastrous budget sinn féin that alternative in our pre budget the road to recovery central to that alternative is the provision of stimulus to the economy so that recovery can come about in the only way possible through the provision of jobs it is as simple as that the provision of jobs through sustainable employment we proposed a billion economic stimulus package with a range of measures to get ireland back to work we proposed measures and savings to billion which would have protected those on low and modest incomes social welfare recipients and public services in this jobs budget will the irish economy and our economic our proposals are not for on a they are proposals and we will continue to them in the months we welcome the fact that people are back against the disastrous policies of this fianna fáil and green party government people have been on the in the past year in numbers in and other of we need economic policies on fairness and with the ability to in providing a decent and decent public services for all such policies also need to confidence sinn féin is that the irish people can from this economic crisis and that we can build a fairer society and sustainable economy those are our not only in respect of this state and this economy but for the economy of the island of ireland as a single economic and political to do that we must the policies on which this budget is based and get of the government which it we demand a better fairer way we say to this government get out of office and give this country back its its right to work and its guarantee of fair opportunity for all who have been on our
